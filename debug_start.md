First, provide your board with logic ( 5V ) power.

The easiest way to do this is by plugging the USB cable into your computer and into the Smoothieboard.

Next, there is a series of [LEDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode) on your board, near the center.

They are labeled `VBB` (red), `3.3V` (orange), and `1` `2` `3` and `4` (all green).

Answer **Yes** if any of the green LEDs are ON or blinking, otherwise answer **No**.
