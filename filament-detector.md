# Filament detector

The filament detector module allows you to add automated hardware to your machine to check that the filament is advancing correctly.

This is done by adding an encoder, that rotates as the filament advances, and sends pulses to the Smoothieboard.

The Smoothieboard then compares those pulses against the current theoretical position of the extruder.

If a difference is detected, the filament is not advancing correctly, which means that there is a problem with the pushing of the filament.

**NOTE** Smoothie uses the host command `action:pause` to tell the host to stop sending gcode. Currently **ONLY** OctoPrint, Pronterface, Smoopi, and printing from SD card support this.

Use `M404` command to set filament detector parameters: S seconds per check, P pulses per mm
Use `M405` command to disable filament detector
Use `M406` command to enable filament detector
Use `M407` command to check if the filament detector gets triggered and to calibrate

## Configuration options

| Option | Example value | Explanation |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| `filament_detector.enable` | `true` | This module is activated only if this is set to `true` |
| `filament_detector.encoder_pin` | `2.11` | This is the pin the encoder is connected to. Must be an interrupt pin |
| `filament_detector.bulge_pin` | `1.31` | OPTIONAL This is the pin the bulge switch is connected to. If this switch is triggered (by a bulge in the filament) and the filament is moving, this will trigger an alarm |
| `filament_detector.seconds_per_check` | `2` | How many seconds between filament position checks, must be long enough for several pulses to be detected, but not too long |
| `filament_detector.pulses_per_mm` | `0.5` | The number of pulses the encoder produces for every millimeter of filament movement |

## Calibration
Disable the detector with `M405`, pull a known length of filament through the detector then see how many pulses were detected with `M407`.
Set the `pulses_per_mm` (in config) to the calculated number (e.g., 20mm generated 50 pulses, so pulses/mm is 50/20= 2.5)
You can set the steps per mm temporarily with `M404 P2.5` to check before changing it in config.
Enable the detector with `M406` and test with a small print. If the detector mis-triggers too often reduce the `pulses_per_mm` and/or increase the check time.

## Hardware

The H/W for this is usually made of an R/C car wheel encoder like this [Wheel Encoder Kit for Robot Car](https://www.amazon.com/Wheel-Encoder-Kit-Robot-Car/dp/B00NPWGEIM). A 3mm bolt goes through it and the filament runs over the shaft and turns the encoder wheel. The module counts the encoder pulses and compares it to how far the filament has moved, if there are no pulses then it triggers the suspend.
This is better than a simple switch as it only triggers if the filament was actually extruded, and only triggers if no pulses were detected.
It will not trigger if there was no extrusion.
