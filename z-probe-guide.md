# Probing

Smoothie allows you to use a probe to do a variety of things:

- Calibrate machine geometry, for example for [delta machines](delta.md)
- Automatically level un-even or non-level surfaces, using either grid or three-point methods
- Automatically find the distance between the tool and either the workpiece or the build surface
- Automatically detect tool lengths

To learn more about probing with Smoothie, read the [zprobe module documentation](/zprobe.md).
