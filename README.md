# SmoothieWare

> It is designed to be very user and hacker friendly. 

The Smoothie project is a free community-built Open-Source controller board and firmware project aimed at all digital fabrication machines ( 3D printers, CNC mills, laser cutters, and more ).

It started years ago as an offshoot of the Reprap project electronics, it aimed at adding the following things:

- Use more powerful hardware ( 32 bits vs 8 bits )
- Be more modular/easier to modify, have cleaner code that’s easier to modify for your needs.
- Support not just 3D printers but also lasers, CNC mills/routers and out of the box, creating a single project more people from different horizons can contribute to
- Easier to use, and more complete, beginner-friendly documentation (at the time all systems required users to compile code to use, Smoothie introduced simple “edit text file and done” configuration )
