## G2 G-code

G2 means "move while activating the tool", in a clockwise arc motion.

This command is equivalent to [G1](g1.md), except the motion is rotational instead of linear.

G2's evil twin is [G3](g3.md), which is exactly the same, except it is counter-clockwise instead of clockwise.

### Format

The command is used as such:

```plaintext
G2 X10 Y20 I30 J40 F100
```

Which means: move to X position 10, Y position 20, while maintaining a constant distance from the point of relative coordinates X 30 and Y 40, at a speed of 100 millimeters/minute.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Usage | Example |
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| `X` | Move to this position in the X axis | G2 X10 I10 |
| `Y` | Move to this position in the Y axis | G2 Y10 I10 |
| `Z` | Move to this position in the Z axis | G2 Z10 I10 |
| `I` | The point in X space from the current X position to maintain a constant distance from | G2 X10 I10 |
| `J` | The point in Y space from the current Y position to maintain a constant distance from | G2 Y10 J10 |
| `K` | The point in Z space from the current Z position to maintain a constant distance from | G2 Z10 K10 |
| `F` | Move at this speed in millimeters/minute (No F parameter results in using last G1 feedrate) | G2 X10 I10 F100 |
