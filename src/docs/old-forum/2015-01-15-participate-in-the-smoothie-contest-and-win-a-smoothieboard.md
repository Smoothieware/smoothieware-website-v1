Hello everybody !

The Smoothie project is organizing a contest in which you have the opportunity to participate in a great Open-Source project, and to **win a Smoothieboard.**

**What’s a Smoothie ?**  
The [Smoothie project’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20150918223511/http://smoothieware.org/) objective is to design a [controller board](https://web.archive.org/web/20150918223511/http://smoothieware.org/smoothieboard) and associated firmware, with the following goals : all Open-Source, simple to use and configure, using powerful hardware, feature-rich, and contributor-friendly.

**How does the contest work ?**  
- There is a website at [http://smoothiecontest.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20150918223511/http://smoothiecontest.org), with project ideas to help inspire you, all of the contests’ rules, and a list of the contest entries so far.  
- You can also email me directly at [flow.arthur@gmail.com](mailto:flow.arthur@gmail.com) if you have any question.

Cheers all, can’t wait to see what kind of stuff you’ll propose !
