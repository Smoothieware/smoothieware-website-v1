We are directly driving my  
[teknicdotcom/model-info/CPM-SDSK-2310S-RLN](teknicdotcom/model-info/CPM-SDSK-2310S-RLN)  
Clear-path servo all-in-one servo motor from the driver breakout pins on the board. The servos have built-in drivers that require 4.5 to 5v logic signal. From what I understand the signals coming from the Smoothie X5 board is 3.3V Does anyone have suggestions or do I end up with a Logic level converter ?
