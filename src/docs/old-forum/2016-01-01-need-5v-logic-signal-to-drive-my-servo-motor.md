Clear-path servo all-in-one servo motor from the driver breakout pins on the board. The servos have built-in drivers that require 4.5 to 5v logic signal. From what I understand the signals coming from the Smoothie X5 board is 3.3V. Does anyone have suggestions or do I end up with a Logic level converter ?
