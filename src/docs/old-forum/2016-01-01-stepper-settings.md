### Stepper settings

I have a Smoothieboard and I'm having a heck of a time getting the size of my prints to be correct. The prints are printing at about 90% their actual size.

I have played with the stepper settings for steps/mm. If I set the steps/mm to 88, I will get correct x/y dimensions, however any circles print in a somewhat oval shape. If I dial the steps back to 80, circles are fine but dimensionally the pieceDeltaTime is not allowed to post.
