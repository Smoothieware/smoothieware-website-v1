Randolph, I need to convert this HTML code into Markdown. Let me start by looking at the structure. There's a lot of HTML elements here, but the main content is within the divs with class "message" and "content". I'll need to extract the text from those sections and format them properly in Markdown.

First, I'll identify the user messages. Each message has a username, date, and content. For example, the first message is from "d3delta3d" on December 28, 2014, and the content is about derating stepper motor current. I'll format that as a blockquote with the username and date.

Next, there's a reply from "arthurwolf" on December 28, 2014, explaining that reducing current can help with noise but might cause skipped steps. I'll place that as a nested blockquote under the first message.

Then, there's another message from "d3delta3d" on December 31, 2014, mentioning the Smoothie board and the current settings. I'll format that as another blockquote with the username and date.

The last message is from "arthurwolf" again, suggesting reducing current but noting the risk of skipped steps. I'll format that as a nested blockquote under the previous message.

I need to make sure the dates are correctly formatted and the usernames are properly attributed. Also, any code snippets or technical terms should be preserved as is. Let me check for any other elements that might need conversion, like links or buttons, but in this case, it seems like the main content is the user messages.

Finally, I'll structure the Markdown with headers for each user message, using blockquotes and proper indentation for replies. That should make the conversation clear and easy to read.

### Derating Stepper Motor Current

> I'm using a Smoothie board and have a question about derating the stepper motor current. I've read that it's common practice to run the motors at about 70% of their rated current to reduce noise and heat. However, I'm not sure how to calculate the correct current setting for my specific motors. Can anyone provide some guidance on this?

> I've been running my motors at 70% of the rated current, and it's working well so far. However, I noticed that the current setting on the Smoothie board is in milliamps (mA), and the motor specs are in amps (A). How do I convert between the two? Also, is there a formula or calculator that can help me determine the optimal current setting for my specific setup?
