The issue with the Z-probe not triggering during auto-leveling (G32) likely stems from misalignment between the probe's position and the bed, or incorrect configuration parameters. Here's a structured approach to resolve this:

---

### **1. Verify Physical Alignment**
- **Check Probe Contact**: Ensure the probe physically touches the bed when the nozzle is at the `zprobe.initial_height` (10mm). If not, adjust the probe's mounting height or the `initial_height` value in the config.
- **Delta Printer Specifics**: For delta printers, the probe must be positioned correctly relative to the bed. Misalignment can cause the probe to miss the bed entirely during grid probing. Use a test probe (e.g., a piece of paper) to confirm contact at all grid points.

---

### **2. Review Configuration Settings**
- **Initial Height**: Your `zprobe.initial_height: 10` is correct. However, if the bed was raised, this value might need adjustment. Test by lowering the initial height incrementally (e.g., 5mm) to see if the probe triggers.
- **Probe Offsets**: Avoid using non-zero `zprobe.delta.grid.probe_offset` values for delta grids. These can cause suboptimal results. Ensure the offset is `[0, 0, 0]` unless absolutely necessary.
- **Endstop Configuration**: Confirm `zprobe.use_endstop: true` is correct. If the endstop is faulty or disconnected, the printer may not trigger the probe.

---

### **3. Firmware and Probe-Specific Checks**
- **BLTouch Calibration**: If using a BLTouch, ensure it is calibrated via the firmware (e.g., using `M574` or `M575` commands). A misconfigured BLTouch may not trigger properly.
- **Pin Configuration**: Verify the probe's pin assignment in the firmware matches your hardware setup. Incorrect pin mapping can prevent the probe from functioning.
- **Trigger Threshold**: Adjust the probe's trigger sensitivity in the firmware if necessary (e.g., `M558 P...` for Marlin-based firmwares).

---

### **4. Test with Diagnostic G-Codes**
- **Manual Probe Test**: Use `G31` (manual probe) to move the nozzle down and check if the probe triggers. If it fails, the issue is likely physical or firmware-related.
- **Endstop Test**: Run `G28` (home all axes) to ensure the endstop works. If the printer doesn't home correctly, the endstop may be faulty.

---

### **5. Advanced Troubleshooting**
- **Signal Check**: Use a multimeter to verify the probe's signal when triggered. A lack of voltage change may indicate a wiring issue.
- **Firmware Logs**: Check for error messages in the firmware logs (if available) that might indicate probe failure or communication issues.

---

### **Example Adjustments**
If the probe isn't triggering due to height:
```ini
zprobe.initial_height: 5  # Lower the initial height

If using a BLTouch:
```ini
zprobe.type: BLTouch
zprobe.bltouch.led: true  # Enable LED for visual feedback

---

By systematically addressing physical alignment, configuration parameters, and firmware settings, you should resolve the probe triggering issue. If problems persist, consider testing with a different probe or consulting your printer's firmware documentation.
