I'm trying to play a file from my SD card, but it's not working. Any ideas?

I tried using the `play` command, but it didn't work. The file is on the SD card, though.

Have you tried renaming the file to have a `.gcode` extension? Sometimes the player expects that specific format.

Damn, I'm sorry. I meant to say a `.gcode` exactly. My mistake. Indeed, renaming your file simply to a `.gcode` will make it work.

### Additional Notes
- The thread includes a link to the [Smoothie app](https://web.archive.org/web/20150909083010/http://www.wikidot.com/smoothie) in the original HTML, though it's not explicitly mentioned in the text.
- The user was advised to check file extensions and ensure compatibility with the player software.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The issue was resolved by renaming the file to use the `.gcode` extension.
- The discussion highlights the importance of file format compatibility when working with 3D printing or CNC software.
