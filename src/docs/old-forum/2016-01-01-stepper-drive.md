I'm trying to drive a 6V 120W motor with a 24V power supply. I need a driver that can handle 2A and 24V. Any recommendations?

You need a driver that can handle 2A and 24V. The Pololu 24V 2A Stepper Motor Driver (https://www.pololu.com/product/1405) is a good option. It supports 24V and can handle up to 2A.

I found a driver on Amazon that claims to handle 2A and 24V. Is it reliable? (https://www.amazon.com/Stepper-Motor-Driver-24V-2A-Board/dp/B07X6JYJ2R)

I haven't used that specific driver, but Pololu's is well-regarded. If you go with the Amazon one, make sure it has proper heatsinking and protection features.

Make sure to follow the Pololu setup guide. Use a heatsink if you're running it near its maximum current. Also, ensure the motor wires are properly connected.

I have another question. Can I use this driver with a 48V power supply?

No, the Pololu driver is rated for up to 24V. Using 48V would damage it. You'd need a different driver for higher voltages.
