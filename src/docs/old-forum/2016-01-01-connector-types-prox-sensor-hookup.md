Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided an HTML snippet from a forum thread and wants it converted to Markdown. First, I need to parse the HTML structure to understand the content.

Looking at the HTML, there's a main container with a post and a reply. The first post is from "Soronemus" asking about connector types and proximity sensor hookup. The second post is from "arthurwolf" with a Google Sheets link. There's also a "New Post" button and some JavaScript at the end.

I need to convert this into Markdown while preserving the structure. The main elements are the thread title, posts, usernames, dates, and links. The Google Sheets link should be a clickable hyperlink. The JavaScript and other hidden elements can be omitted since they're not part of the visible content.

I should start with the thread title, then list each post with the username, date, and content. Make sure to use proper Markdown syntax for links and italics where necessary. Also, check for any special characters that need escaping, but in this case, it seems straightforward.

Wait, the user mentioned "Markdown:" at the end, so they probably want the converted Markdown after that. Let me structure it with headers for the thread, then each post as a section. Use bold for usernames and dates, and ensure the link is properly formatted. Avoid any HTML tags and use Markdown elements like paragraphs, links, and italics as needed.

Double-check that all the content from the HTML is included, like the two posts and the link. Make sure the dates are in the correct format and the usernames are properly noted. Also, the "New Post" button might be part of the forum interface, but since the user didn't mention including it, maybe it's safe to omit unless specified. However, looking back, the original HTML includes it, but the user's example response didn't include it. Hmm, maybe the user just wants the thread content, not the buttons. I'll focus on the posts and their content.

Alright, putting it all together now.

# Connector Types? Prox Sensor Hookup

## Post by Soronemus (27 May 2016 15:02)
I'm looking for information about the types of connectors used in 3D printing electronics, specifically for the Smoothieboard. Additionally, I need guidance on how to properly hook up a proximity sensor (like a Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F) to the board. Any help or resources would be greatly appreciated!
