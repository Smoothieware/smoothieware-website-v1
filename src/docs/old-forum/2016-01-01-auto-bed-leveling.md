### Auto Bed Leveling

**Content:**  
Hello, I'm using a Smoothieboard and I'm trying to figure out how to set up the firmware for my 3D printer. I've followed the instructions on the website, but I'm getting an error when I try to compile the code. The error message says `'undefined reference to 'function_name''`. Can anyone help me with this?

Not at the moment, but plans are in the works for autolevelling for Cartesian machines, and auto calibration for Delta type machines.
