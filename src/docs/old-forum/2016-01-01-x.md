I'm trying to figure out the best way to connect two Y-axis stepper motors to the Azteeg X5 board. Here are my considerations:

1. The X5 has four stepper drivers, which is why I chose it. I'm wondering if I should use the dual Z-axis drivers or repurpose the extruder driver as a second Y-axis driver.

2. I know that one Y-axis motor needs to spin in the opposite direction of the other. How does this affect wiring and configuration?

3. Previously, I've seen setups where two Y-axis motors are wired in parallel/serial to a single driver. But with the X5's four drivers, I'd prefer to use two separate drivers.

4. If using the extruder driver as a second Y-axis driver, would that work? The extruder driver seems identical to the others on the X5.

Any guidance on wiring and editing the config file would be greatly appreciated.
