# Current control problem

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread discussing a current control problem with a motor and a board. They also mentioned that the user wants the content converted into Markdown. 

First, I need to parse the HTML to extract the relevant information. The HTML has multiple posts from users "JonesR" and "arthurwolf" discussing the issue. The main points are about the motor wiring configuration (parallel to series), current measurements, and questions about how the current is being measured.

I should structure the Markdown to represent each post with headers, maybe using bold for usernames and dates. I'll need to ensure that the technical terms like "parallel to series" and "current consumption" are clearly presented. Also, the questions from "arthurwolf" should be highlighted as they are important for understanding the problem.

I should check for any HTML entities that need to be converted, like &amp; for ampersands. Also, make sure that the dates are formatted consistently. The user might want the Markdown to be readable and maintain the conversation flow between the two users.

Another thing to note is the mention of "RobotShop" in the original HTML, which might be a reference to where the board was purchased. Including that could be helpful context. Also, the part where "JonesR" mentions the gauge showing 0.75 amps but not the full amps is a key point that should be clearly stated.

I need to avoid any markdown formatting that wasn't requested, like tables or code blocks, unless necessary. Since the user just wants the content converted, keeping it simple with headers, bold text for names and dates, and bullet points for the questions and answers would be appropriate.

Finally, I'll review the Markdown to ensure it accurately reflects the original HTML content without any omissions or errors. Making sure that each post is separated and the conversation is easy to follow.

> I changed the wiring of the motor from parallel to series. Now, the gauge shows about 0.75 amps, but it's still not reaching the full amps expected.

> **Questions:**
> 1. Are you measuring the board's current consumption when the motor is held in place (i.e., under load)?
> 2. How are you measuring the current? (e.g., using a multimeter, inline ammeter, etc.)

> **Additional Context:**
> - The board was purchased from RobotShop.
> - The user is troubleshooting why the motor isn't drawing the expected current despite changing the wiring configuration.

### **Key Details**
- **Issue:** Motor current not reaching expected levels (0.75A vs. full amps).
- **Action Taken:** Changed motor wiring from parallel to series.
- **Unclear Factors:** 
  - Whether current is measured under load.
  - Methodology for current measurement.
