# DC motor + encoders with Smoothie

I'm trying to use DC motors with encoders on a Smoothie board. Is this possible? I've heard that Smoothie is primarily designed for stepper motors, but I'm curious if there's a way to make it work with DC motors as well.

The Smoothie project is currently on hold, and the development team hasn't made any updates regarding support for DC motors. If you're looking for a solution, I'd recommend replacing the DC motors with stepper motors, as Smoothie is optimized for that. Alternatively, you might need to use a different controller board that supports DC motor control.
