# Unable to mount SD Card in Ubuntu via USB

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants me to convert it into Markdown. The original HTML has a discussion between two users, BarkEngMad and arthurwolf, about an SD card issue with a Smoothieboard.

First, I need to parse the HTML structure. The main elements are the forum thread title, user posts, timestamps, and the content of each message. The HTML uses divs with classes like "post-container", "long", "short", and various other elements for styling.

I should start by identifying the thread title. In the HTML, there's a div with class "page-title" containing the text "Unable to mount SD card in Ubuntu via USB". That will be the Markdown heading.

Next, the user posts. Each post has a username, timestamp, and message. For example, the first post by BarkEngMad mentions the problem with the SD card not mounting in Ubuntu. The second reply from arthurwolf suggests checking the file system and using a different card. Then BarkEngMad follows up with more details, and arthurwolf apologizes and mentions that new boards come with better cards.

I need to structure each post with the username, timestamp, and message. In Markdown, I can use bold for usernames and italic for timestamps. Each message should be a separate paragraph, maybe using blockquotes or just plain text with indentation.

I should also check for any special characters or formatting in the original HTML that need to be preserved. For example, the use of "\o/" in one of the messages should remain as is. Also, the mention of "NTFS" and "FAT32" should be kept in uppercase since they are file system types.

I need to make sure that the conversation flow is clear, with each user's message properly separated and attributed. Avoid using any HTML tags in the Markdown, just plain text with appropriate formatting.

I have a Smoothieboard (v1.1) and I'm trying to use it with Ubuntu. When I plug in the SD card, it doesn't show up in the file manager. I tried using a different card, but the same issue occurs. Any ideas?

Have you checked the file system type of the SD card? Smoothieboard might not support NTFS. Try formatting it to FAT32.

I tried a new card, and it worked when connected directly to the computer, but not through the Smoothieboard. The card shows up in the device manager but isn't accessible. Could there be a driver issue?

Sorry for the bad SD cards, it's the manufacturer's fault. New Smoothieboards come with legitimate SD cards.

Wait, the original HTML has some more details. Let me check again. The first message from BarkEngMad mentions the Smoothieboard v1.1 and the problem with the SD card not mounting. Arthurwolf suggests checking the file system and using FAT32. Then BarkEngMad replies with more details about the card working on the computer but not the Smoothieboard. Arthurwolf apologizes and mentions that new boards have better cards.

I need to ensure all these points are included. Also, the timestamps in the HTML are in Unix time, but the user probably wants them converted to readable dates. The original timestamps in the HTML are like "1415026994" which is November 4, 2014 16:43:14 UTC. But in the HTML, the rendered timestamps are in local time, like "November 4, 2014 16:44" and "November 5, 2014 08:55".

So I'll use those rendered timestamps. Also, the user mentions "Smoothieboard (v1.1)" which should be included.

Another thing: in the HTML, the first post by BarkEngMad has a timestamp of "1415026994" which is converted to "November 4, 2014 16:44" in the HTML. The second post by arthurwolf is "1415027054" which is "November 4, 2014 16:44" as well? Wait, looking back, the HTML has:

First post: "1415026994" → "November 4, 2014 16:44"  
Second post: "1415027054" → "November 4, 2014 16:44"  
Third post: "1415177734" → "November 5, 2014 08:55"  
Fourth post: "1415177831" → "November 5, 2014 08:57"

So the first two posts are on the same day, but the timestamps in the HTML are slightly different. However, the user might prefer the exact timestamps as they appear in the HTML, which are "November 4, 2014 16:44" and "November 4, 2014 16:44" for the first two messages. Wait, looking at the HTML again:

First post: "1415026994" → "November 4, 2014 16:44"  
Second post: "1415027054" → "November 4, 2014 16:44"  
Third post: "1415177734" → "November 5, 2014 08:55"  
Fourth post: "1415177831" → "November 5, 2014 08:57"

So the first two posts are on the same day, but the exact times are slightly different. However, in the HTML, they are both displayed as "November 4, 2014 16:44". Maybe the original HTML rounds the time. For consistency, I'll use the exact timestamps as they appear in the HTML.

Putting it all together, the Markdown should have the thread title as a heading, then each post with the username in bold, timestamp in italics, and the message. Also, the final message from arthurwolf includes an apology and info about new boards.

I need to make sure that the Markdown is properly formatted, with each post separated, and any special characters like "\o/" are preserved. Also, the mention of "NTFS" and "FAT32" should be in uppercase as they are technical terms.

Another thing: the user might have included some HTML comments or other elements, but in the Markdown, those should be omitted, focusing only on the content.

So the final Markdown should look like:

I think that's all. Each post is separated, with proper formatting. The timestamps are as per the HTML, and the content is accurately represented.
