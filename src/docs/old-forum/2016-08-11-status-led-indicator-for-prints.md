Hello,

I have a LED that I want to use as a status indicator for my 3D printer. Is there a way to connect it to the printer's control board so that it lights up when the printer is actively printing?

Thanks in advance!

I believe you got an answer on IRC, but I'm answering anyway in case somebody finds this topic. You need to use the "play" LED, which does exactly this.

Cheers.
