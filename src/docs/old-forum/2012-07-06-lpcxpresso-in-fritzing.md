You are not the first to ask.  
I had to make it by hand, it was an absolute pain, and I can't find a way to export it, the exported files always come out empty …  
If you contact me by email ([moc.liamg|ruhtra.flow#moc.liamg|ruhtra.flow](mailto:moc.liamg|ruhtra.flow#moc.liamg|ruhtra.flow)) I can send you all the files I have, and you can see if you can do something with them.
