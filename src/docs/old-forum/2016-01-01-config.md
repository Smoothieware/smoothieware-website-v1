> Hi,  
>  
> I have a question about the `config-override` file. When I delete the `config-override` file and re-create it with the correct settings, the old settings from the previous `config-override` file still show up. Why is this happening? I thought deleting the file would remove all previous settings.

> The `config-override` file **overrides** the values in the "normal" config file. For example, if you set your steps per mm in the `config-override` file, the values in the "config" file are ignored.  
>  
> There is **no automatic transfer** of values between the two files. If you want to use the latest settings, ensure that the `config-override` file contains the correct values and that no older versions are lingering in the system.

> Cheers!
