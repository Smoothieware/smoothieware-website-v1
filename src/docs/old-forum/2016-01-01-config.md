# config

Okay, let's see. The user provided an HTML snippet from a forum thread and wants the corresponding Markdown. The task is to convert that HTML into Markdown while preserving the structure and content.

First, I need to parse the HTML. The main elements are the forum thread with two posts. The first post is from BLB2015 asking about the config-override file, and the second is a reply from arthurwolf explaining that config-override overrides the normal config file.

I should start by identifying the headers. The thread title is "config-override" and there are two posts. In Markdown, each post can be a section with a heading. The first post is the original question, and the second is the reply.

Next, the user mentions that the config-override file overrides the normal config. The answer explains that there's no automatic transfer between the files. I need to make sure that the key points are captured in the Markdown, using appropriate formatting like bold for emphasis and code blocks if necessary.

I should check for any links or references. The HTML has links to user profiles, but in Markdown, those can be converted to simple text or left as is if they're not clickable. The dates are in the format "28 Oct 2015 14:42", which should be kept as is.

Also, the HTML has some JavaScript and script tags, but those are not part of the content and can be ignored. The main content is within the divs with classes like "post" and "content".

I need to structure the Markdown with headers for each post, include the usernames and dates, and the body of the posts. Since it's a forum thread, using a numbered list or sections with headings might be appropriate.

Wait, the user provided an example Markdown, but it's empty. So I need to create the Markdown from scratch based on the HTML. Let me outline the structure:

- Thread Title: # config-override
- Post 1: User: BLB2015, Date: 28 Oct 2015 14:42, Content: Question about config-override
- Post 2: User: arthurwolf, Date: 28 Oct 2015 20:40, Content: Explanation that config-override overrides the normal config

In Markdown, each post can be a section with a heading, maybe using ### for the post titles. The usernames and dates can be in italics or bold. The content should be in paragraphs, with any key terms like "config-override" possibly in code formatting if relevant.

I should also check for any special characters that need escaping in Markdown, but the content here seems straightforward. The answer mentions "steps per mm" which is a technical term, so maybe using backticks for code snippets.

Putting it all together, the Markdown should have the thread title as a heading, followed by each post with their respective details and content. Ensuring that the structure is clear and the information is accurately represented.

# config-override

## Post by BLB2015 (28 Oct 2015 14:42)

Hi,

I'm having trouble understanding how the `config-override` file works. Specifically, I noticed that after making changes to my main configuration file, the `config-override` file seems to be taking precedence. Could someone explain how this file interacts with the main configuration?

I've tried deleting the `config-override` file, but the system still seems to be using some default values. Is there a way to ensure that the main configuration is used unless explicitly overridden?

Thanks in advance for any help!

Hey,

The `config-override` file is designed to **override** the values in the main configuration file. For example, if you set your `steps per mm` in the `config-override` file, the values in the main `config` file will be ignored.

There is **no automatic transfer** of values between the two files. If you want to use a value from the main config, you must explicitly define it in the `config-override` file.

Cheers.
