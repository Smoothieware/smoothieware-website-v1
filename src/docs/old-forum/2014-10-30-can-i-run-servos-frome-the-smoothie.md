Maybe you can change the parameters of the drives to accept pulses instead of an analog signal.  
I know that it is definitely possible for Omron Accurax G5 and Yaskawa Sigma II drives but I don't know your Fanuc drives.  
Check the manual for details!

**Note:** The original HTML included some JavaScript and hidden elements (e.g., `post-options-template`), which were omitted for clarity. The focus here is on the forum discussion about configuring servo drives to work with a Smoothie board.
