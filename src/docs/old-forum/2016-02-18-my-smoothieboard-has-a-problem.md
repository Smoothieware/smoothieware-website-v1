I have a SmoothieBoard that is not working properly. The Z-axis does not move at all. I have checked the wiring and it seems correct. The board is powered and the LED is on. I have tried different firmware versions but the problem persists. Any ideas?

I had a similar issue with my SmoothieBoard. It turned out to be a faulty stepper motor driver. I replaced the driver and the Z-axis started working. Have you checked the motor driver?

I am building an Eclips3d corexy printer. Thank you for the help. When you are ready for more beta testers for the Version 2 board I am interested in helping. (I am an experienced system programmer.)
