**Need help with direction of motor**

Hey,


I am trying to run external drivers with 3 phase steppers (3 cable). I have latest stable firmware and running pronter to test. Everything seems to work, I get the right steps per mm and all but, the motor always turns in the same direction. I cant figure it out. I thought it might be 3.3v to 5v issue, so I tried common anode and then the drives just go into fault and dont work at all. I also tried to change step pulse duration and tried 1 to 10 and everything in between and that didnt solve it either.

What could be the problem?

Thanks
