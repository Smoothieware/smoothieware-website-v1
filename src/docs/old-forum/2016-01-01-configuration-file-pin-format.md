# configuration file pin format?

*Original post date: 2016-01-01*

---

SXG: Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML and JavaScript code from a forum thread discussion about the configuration file pin format for a Smoothieboard. They want me to convert this into Markdown. 

First, I need to parse the HTML structure. There are multiple posts from different users. Each post has a username, timestamp, and content. The challenge is to represent this in a structured Markdown format that's easy to read.

I should start by identifying each post. The first post is from "arthurwolf" on February 19, 2013, at 17:42. The content includes links to the GitHub repository and an example config file. Then there's a reply from "Chelmite" earlier the same day, asking about the configuration options. 

I need to make sure the usernames and timestamps are properly formatted. Using headers for each post, maybe with the username in bold and the timestamp in italics. The links should be converted to Markdown links. Also, code snippets like the GitHub URLs should be in backticks or as clickable links.

I should check for any nested elements or special characters that need escaping. The HTML has some JavaScript functions and inline styles, but in Markdown, those aren't necessary. Focus on the text content and structure.

Another thing is the "Reply" button in the last post. Since it's part of the forum interface, maybe mention that in the Markdown as a note, but the user might just want the conversation threads. 

I'll structure each post with a header, then the content, and any links. Make sure the example config file link is properly formatted. Also, the timestamps should be in a consistent format, maybe using the date and time as provided.

Wait, the first post from arthurwolf has a reply from Chelmite, but in the HTML, the order is Chelmite's post first, then arthurwolf's reply. Need to maintain the chronological order as per the original HTML. Let me check the timestamps again. Chelmite's post is from 19 Feb 2013 17:40, and arthurwolf's reply is 19 Feb 2013 17:42. So the order is correct as Chelmite first, then arthurwolf's response.

So, in Markdown, each post will be a section with the username, timestamp, and content. Links should be converted to Markdown links. Also, the code repository links should be hyperlinked. 

I need to ensure that the Markdown is clean and readable, without any HTML tags. Use proper indentation for code blocks if necessary, but in this case, the links are just text with URLs.

Hi!  
The config options are understood by the Smoothie firmware. Each module has its own set of options, which you can find by browsing the code:  
[Smoothie GitHub Repository](https://github.com/arthurwolf/Smoothie)  
A good starting point to get a list of (most) config options is the example config file:  
[Example Config File](https://github.com/arthurwolf/Smoothie/blob/edge/ConfigSamples/Smoothieboard/config)  
Cheers 😊
