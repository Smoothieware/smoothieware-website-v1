I'm asking about tool radius offsets. Are they currently supported?

Hey!

Tool radius offsets are not currently supported. Actually, most of the "manual" G-code features are not supported, as Smoothie is mostly used in conjunction with CAM software.

It shouldn't be -too- hard to add, but it's work still.

Cheers!
