Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants me to convert it into Markdown. The original HTML has multiple posts with usernames, dates, and messages. My task is to structure this information in a clear and readable Markdown format.

First, I need to parse each post. Each post has a title, author, date, and content. The HTML uses div elements with classes like "post-container", "long", "short", etc. The usernames are within "printuser" spans, dates are in "odate" spans, and the content is in "content" divs.

I should start by creating a header for the forum thread, maybe using a heading like "## Forum Thread: Does Smoothieboard Have Travel Limits After Homing Function?" to capture the main topic.

Then, for each post, I'll use a numbered list or sections with headers. Each post can be a section with the author's name, date, and the message content. Using bold for the author and date might help highlight them. For example:

**Author:** flyway97  
**Date:** 14 Apr 2015 16:58  
**Message:**  
This is the content of the post.

I need to make sure that the replies are properly nested under their respective threads. The original HTML has replies with "Re: " in the title, so in Markdown, I can use indentation or subheadings to indicate the reply structure. However, since the user didn't specify nesting, maybe just listing each post in order with their respective replies as separate entries would be sufficient.

Also, the dates are in Unix timestamp format, so converting them to a more readable format like "14 Apr 2015 16:58" would be better. Wait, looking at the HTML, the dates are already in a format like "14 Apr 2015 16:58" in the "odate" span, so I can directly use that.

I should check for any special characters in the content that need escaping in Markdown, but the provided content seems straightforward. The user might want the Markdown to be as close to the original structure as possible, preserving the order and hierarchy of the posts.

Another thing is the "New Post" button at the end. Since the user is asking for the conversion of the existing posts, maybe the "New Post" section can be omitted unless specified otherwise.

Putting it all together, the Markdown should have a clear structure with each post's details, properly formatted and easy to read. I'll go through each post in the HTML, extract the necessary information, and present it in a structured way.

No, it doesn't have that feature. It's not implemented yet.  
Cheers.

Hey.  
It's a bit difficult to add. If somebody wants to add it, that's surely welcome, I expect somebody will do it at some point.  
Cheers.

**Note:** The original HTML had duplicate content in posts 1 and 3. The Markdown above reflects the unique content from the original thread.
