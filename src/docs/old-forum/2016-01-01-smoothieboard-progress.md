# Smoothieboard Progress Discussion

## User's Question

I have a question regarding the Smoothieboard's progress functionality. Specifically, I want to know:

1. Is there a way to abort a command (like the jog commands)?
2. In my opinion, it's kind of risky to have no option to abort a command, especially if the command results in a move. Should the behavior of the abort command be changed to affect all commands?

Hi Arthur,

Thank you for the answers! I will try the M114 tomorrow.
