Offline Web Interface

Hey, I'm trying to use the web interface for my Smoothie device, but it doesn't work when I'm offline. I tried modifying the HTML file to include local resources, but the buttons aren't functioning properly. Does anyone know how to make the web interface work offline?

Re: Offline Web Interface

If you want, you can put any HTML file you want (including the web interface) on the SD card. Then you access it at [http://smoothie's_ip/sd/your_file.html](http://smoothie's_ip/sd/your_file.html). Hope that helps.
