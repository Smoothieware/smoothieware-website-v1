# HeeksCNC arcs

🖇️ Alright, let's tackle this. The user provided a block of HTML from a forum thread discussing HeeksCNC arcs and wants it converted to Markdown. First, I need to parse the HTML structure to extract the relevant information.

Looking at the HTML, there are multiple posts with usernames, dates, and content. Each post has a title, author, date, and message. The challenge is to convert this into a structured Markdown format that's easy to read.

I should start by identifying each post section. The posts are within divs with class "post" and have unique IDs like "post-2236555". Each post has a "short" section with the title, author, and date, and a "long" section with the content.

For each post, I'll create a heading with the title, then list the author and date, followed by the content. I'll use bold for the author and date to make them stand out. Also, the replies and options like "Reply" and "Edit" should be included if present.

I need to make sure that the Markdown is properly formatted with headers, lists, and proper indentation. Also, any code snippets, like the file path mentioned, should be in code blocks for clarity.

I'm trying to use HeeksCNC to generate G-code for a part with arcs, but the output doesn't seem to include the arc commands (G02/G03). Instead, it's using straight line segments. Is there a setting I'm missing that would enable arc generation?

I just tried using the "Use arcs" option in the post-processing settings, but it didn't make a difference. The G-code still only has G01 commands.

I'm using HeeksCNC 0.9.1 on Windows 7. The part I'm trying to mill has a circular pocket that should be created with an arc.

I've attached a screenshot of the toolpath preview. It shows the circular motion, but the G-code only has straight lines.
