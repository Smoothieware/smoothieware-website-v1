# Using PTC (PT100/PT1000) with Smoothie Firmware

## Post by hariantos (25 Mar 2015)
I found a solution for using PT100/PT1000 sensors with Smoothie firmware by modifying the thermistor calculation. Here's the polynomial equation I used:


R = 1000 * (1 + (T/100) + (T/100)^2 + (T/100)^3 + (T/100)^4)

Where:
- `R` = Resistance of the PT100 sensor
- `T` = Temperature in °C

I implemented this in the `Thermistor.cpp` file by replacing the default thermistor table with this polynomial calculation. The resolution was sufficient for my needs (~0.1°C).

Hi hariantos,

Nice work with the PT100 solution! I'm trying to implement this too. Could you share:
1. Your complete config file for temperature control?
2. How you configured Smoothie to use the polynomial formula?
3. What resolution you achieved with your setup?

I'm particularly interested in how the firmware handles the polynomial calculation and if there are any calibration steps needed.

Thanks!
