Hi everyone!

I was wondering if we could create a wiki for the Smoothie project. It would be great to have a centralized place for documentation, tutorials, and information about upcoming features. I think this would help both new and existing users get more involved with the project.

Also, I'm curious about the status of the tutorials. Are they being worked on? It would be helpful to have a FAQ section as well.

Cheers!

Hi!

Actually, the entire website is already a wiki! You can click "Edit" at the bottom of any page to contribute.

As for upcoming features, we have a list here: [Upcoming Features](https://github.com/Smoothieware/Smoothieware/wiki/Upcoming-features).

Work is currently underway on the tutorials, including a FAQ section. We're excited about the progress being made!

Cheers! 😊

**Note:** The website's wiki functionality allows users to edit pages directly. For major feature updates, refer to the [Upcoming Features](https://github.com/Smoothieware/Smoothieware/wiki/Upcoming-features) page on GitHub.
