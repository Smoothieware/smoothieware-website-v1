# How to add Rotate Axis (4th Axis) to smoothieware CNC?

Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided an HTML snippet from a forum thread and wants the corresponding Markdown. The task is to convert the HTML into Markdown while preserving the structure and content.

First, I need to parse the HTML. The main elements are the forum thread with two posts. Each post has a title, author, date, and content. There are also links and some JavaScript, but those can be ignored for the Markdown.

Starting with the first post: the user is asking about adding a 4th axis to a Smoothieware CNC. The answer from arthurwolf includes links to the CNC mill guide and software recommendations. I need to make sure the links are correctly formatted in Markdown.

I should structure the Markdown with headers for each post, using the "Re:" in the second post's title. The authors and dates should be included as part of the post metadata. The content of each post should be in paragraphs, with links converted to Markdown format.

Also, the user mentioned that if the content is not suitable for Markdown, respond with "NO". But since this is a forum thread, it's definitely suitable. I need to ensure that any HTML tags are removed, and the text is properly formatted with headers, links, and proper indentation for lists if needed.

Wait, the first post has three questions. The answer addresses each with a numbered list. So in Markdown, using numbers for each point would be appropriate. The links provided in the answer should be converted to Markdown links.

I should check for any special characters that need escaping, but in this case, it seems straightforward. Also, the dates are in the format "21 Mar 2016 12:40", which should be kept as is.

Finally, the JavaScript at the end can be omitted since it's not part of the content. The rest of the HTML structure is converted into Markdown sections for each post, maintaining the original order and information.

1. Is it possible to use multiple stepper drivers for a single axis (e.g., two drivers for X-axis)?
2. How can I add a 4th axis (rotary table) to my Smoothieware CNC setup?
3. What software is recommended for generating G-code for a 4th-axis CNC?

1. [Smoothieware CNC Mill Guide - Multiple Stepper Drivers](https://web.archive.org/web/20160530053112/http://smoothieware.org/cnc-mill-guide#toc27)
2. You'll need to use the **Extruder module** for the 4th axis, as it provides similar functionality to a standard axis.
3. Recommended software: [Smoothieware Software Page](https://web.archive.org/web/20160530053112/http://smoothieware.org/software)

Cheers.
