The Smoothieboard uses the SD card to store the firmware and configuration. If you want to boot without an SD card, you need to have the firmware already on the board. However, without the SD card, you won't be able to update the firmware or change the configuration.

Yes, you can boot the Smoothieboard without an SD card if the firmware is already loaded onto the board. However, some features that rely on the SD card (like custom configurations or firmware updates) won't be available.
