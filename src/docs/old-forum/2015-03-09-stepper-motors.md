# Stepper Motors - Strange Behavior

## Post by klema (09 Mar 2015 16:24)
I have a custom PCB with a STM32F407 and 5 A4988 stepper motor drivers. When I stop the motors, they make a loud noise. I've tested with different motor configurations and the noise persists. Is this normal behavior?

Depending on the noise, that could be perfectly normal. Do you have a video of this?
