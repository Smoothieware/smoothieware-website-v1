I'm trying to pause the printer then move the print head out of the way before resuming with `G0 Z300`  
When I resume with M25 the printer resumes printing at the new height of 300mm above the bed until the layer completes. Then it moves back down to the proper z height. Can anyone let me know how I can overcome this?

-Thanks
