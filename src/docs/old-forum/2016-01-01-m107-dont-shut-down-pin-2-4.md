# M107 dont shut down pin 2.4

I'm having an issue where M107 isn't shutting down pin 2.4. I installed a fan and a MOSFET, but the fan is running continuously. I tried restoring the firmware, but the problem persists. Any ideas?

Did you install a diode on the output? If not, the fan probably killed the MOSFET.
