# M107 don't shut down pin 2.4

I'm having an issue where the M107 command isn't shutting down pin 2.4. I've tried restoring the firmware and checking the connections, but the problem persists. Any ideas what could be causing this?

Did you install a diode on the output?  
If not, the fan probably killed the mosfet.
