# RepRap GLCD Encoder not working?

جريمة

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum discussion about a Smoothieboard and a RepRap GLCD encoder not working. The original question was about why the encoder wasn't functioning, and the answers mentioned soldering pins that were missing. Now, the user wants a Markdown version of this content.

First, I need to parse the HTML and extract the relevant parts. The main content is the forum thread with posts from Brian Lapolt and ACMEracer. The key points are the problem description, the solution (soldering missing pins), and the follow-up from another user confirming the same issue.

I should structure the Markdown with headers for each post, using bold for names and italic for dates. The code block with the HTML should be included as a code snippet. Also, the user mentioned "جريمة" which might be a typo or a misplaced word. Since the main content is in English, I'll focus on translating the HTML to Markdown, ensuring the technical details about the pins and soldering are clear.

I need to make sure that the Markdown is properly formatted with appropriate headings, lists, and code blocks. Also, check for any special characters that need escaping. The final output should be a clean, readable Markdown version of the forum discussion.

I'm having trouble with the encoder on my RepRap GLCD not working. The encoder only brings up the menu and doesn't respond to the buttons. I've checked the wiring and everything seems connected properly. Any ideas?

If it makes you feel better, I did the exact same thing. The Smoothieboard had all of the pins soldered on the board except these three pins. Messed with it for about an hour before I found your post above and checked.
