# G32 error

Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided an HTML snippet from a forum thread and wants the corresponding Markdown. First, I need to parse the HTML and convert it into a structured Markdown format.

Looking at the HTML, there's a thread with two posts. The first post is from "Worrierking" asking about a G32 error, and the second is from "arthurwolf" asking some questions. The task is to convert this into Markdown, preserving the structure and content.

I should start by identifying the main sections: the thread title, the posts, each with author, date, and content. The HTML has classes like "post-container", "long", "short", and elements with IDs. The first post has a title "G32 error" and the second is "Re: G32 error".

I need to make sure that the Markdown uses headers for the thread title, maybe bold for the authors, and proper indentation for replies. Also, the code snippets like `gamma_max` and `G28` should be in backticks.

Wait, the user mentioned "Markdown: " at the end, so they probably want the actual Markdown code. Let me structure it with headers, each post as a section, and the replies indented. Also, the links and buttons in the HTML might not be necessary in Markdown, so I can omit them unless specified.

Check for any other elements: the script tag and other divs with styles can be ignored. Focus on the content within the posts. The first post's content is two paragraphs, the second has a few questions. Make sure to preserve the line breaks and formatting.

Also, the user might want the Markdown to be as close as possible to the original structure, so using proper headers and lists. Maybe using > for quotes if it's a reply, but since it's a forum thread, using a header for each post and indenting replies could work.


Double-check that all the content from the HTML is included, without any extra information. Avoid any HTML tags in the Markdown, just plain text with proper formatting. That should cover it.

When I run G32, the printer crashes into the end stops. I've tried running M300 to reset the position, but that doesn't help. Any ideas?


M300
G28
G32

I've also tried adjusting the `gamma_max` parameter, but that didn't seem to help either.

Hey.

Do you have `gamma_max` set?

Does homing with `G28` work correctly?

Can we see your config file?

Cheers.
