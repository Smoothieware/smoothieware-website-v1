# Smoothieboard freezing over SUB

*Original post date: 2016-01-01*

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants me to convert it into Markdown. The original HTML has three posts: the initial problem from Pointy, a response from ArthurWolf, and a follow-up from Pointy again.

First, I need to parse each post and extract the content. The first post is from Pointy describing the issue with the Smoothieboard freezing over USB. The second is ArthurWolf's advice about USB cables and testing. The third is Pointy's update that a shorter cable worked.

I should structure each post with headers indicating the user and date. Using Markdown, I can use bold for names and dates, and separate each post with a line break. Also, the code has some JavaScript and other elements, but those aren't needed in the Markdown. Focus on the text content within the posts.

Check for any special characters that need escaping in Markdown, but in this case, it seems straightforward. Make sure the replies are properly indented under the original post. Use quotes or dashes to indicate replies. Wait, the original HTML has "Re: " in the titles, so in Markdown, maybe using a dash or a quote for replies.

Also, the dates are in the format "13 Feb 2015 14:58", which should be kept as is. Ensure that the user names are bolded and the dates are in italics or just plain text. Maybe use a colon to separate the user and date.

Putting it all together, each post starts with the user's name and date, followed by their message. Replies are indented with a dash or something similar. Let me structure each post with the user and date, then the content. Make sure to keep the original message's structure, like the "Thanks for the rapid response..." part.

Double-check that all three posts are included and properly formatted. Avoid any HTML tags, just plain Markdown. Use line breaks between posts and maybe bold the usernames. That should cover it.

I'm having issues with my Smoothieboard freezing when using USB. The problem occurs during printing, and I've tried multiple software configurations without success. The board works fine when connected via the web interface, but USB communication seems unstable. Any suggestions?

Thanks for the rapid response, I found a shorter (about 1m) USB cable and the first print was successful, I'll do some more testing.
