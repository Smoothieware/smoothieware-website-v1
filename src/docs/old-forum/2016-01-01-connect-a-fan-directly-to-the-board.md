# Connect a Fan Directly to the Board

**Posted by Chris Leamon on March 10, 2016, 2:10 AM**

The green connectors are for the power supply, and the small connectors are for the MOSFETs. I have a 3D-printed enclosure that I designed on [Thingiverse link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:123456). Can I use any of the small connectors for the fan? I'm a bit confused about the power setup. Any help would be appreciated.

Actually, I may have figured it out. Using the jumper to set the power to the small MOSFETs to VBB they will always be on. Now just to make sure I know what I am doing. I have added the jumper to Q8 & Q9, then I will not need the power in connector plugged in as it will be getting its power from VBB. Can I then use any of the small connectors for the fan?
