**X-Carve using Azteeg X5 ~ Dual (slaved) Y Axis Connection/Config?**  
by [Le Chapeux Pyrate](https://web.archive.org/web/20160629064044/http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/le-chapeux-pyrate), 22 Jun 2015 15:48

I am building the new X-Carve (similar to the Shapeoko as they both have 2 stepper motors on the nihil Y Axis) and then lead into a single driver (I forget if it's serial or parallel or what) ~ but I am leaning to ignoring this method (as it's relating to a board with only 3 drivers) ~ since the Azteeg X5 gives you 4 stepper drivers. (that's why I got the X5!)

Another consideration is that I am pretty sure that one of the Y Axis Stepper Motors should be turning in the opposite direction of the other (woo my head is spinning much the same ;{P )

I am thinking as well that there may be an alternative to using the dual Z Axis driver ~ maybe using the Extruder Driver for a second Y Axis driver (as it seems to be the exact same Stepper Driver as the ones designated on the wiring diagram of the Azteeg X5)…

If so to either method ~ then some guidance on connecting and editing the Config file would be greatly appreciated.
