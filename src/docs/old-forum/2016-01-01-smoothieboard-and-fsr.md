I'm considering using FSRs with my Smoothieboard. Has anyone successfully integrated them? Any tips on the setup?

I have found that three FSRs in parallel will reliably trigger an endstop pin on the smoothieboard without any other circuitry. I have them mounted under my printbed on a Kossel mini. I did have to experiment a bit with the physical mounting to get it right (varying the size of the contact patch between FSR and bed).  

Cheers,  
Robin.
