You're asking about wiring a Viki 2.0 display to a 5-driver Smoothieboard (SBx5). Here's a breakdown of your questions:

**Wiring Reference:**
- SDCD to P0.27
- BTN to P1.30
- SDCS to P2.8
- LCS to P0.16
**SCK to P0.15**
- GND to 5v (Note: This seems incorrect - GND should connect to ground, not 5v)
- ENCB to P3.26
- ENCA to P3.25
**MISO to P0.8**
- A0 to P2.11
**MOSI to P0.18**
- +Vin to 5v power supply

**Additional Notes:**
- The BTN connection: Viki 2.0 has 2 Blue BTN wires that perform the same function
- Buzzer to P1.31 (Note: This is commented out in the x5 config)
- Blue-LED to P1.23 (Note: This is commented out in the x5 config)
- Red-LED to P1.22 (Note: The x5 config uses P1.31 for Red LED)

**Power Questions:**
- Can I use 3.3v and GND near P0.16? Yes, but ensure proper voltage regulation
- Can I power Smoothie and Viki2 from USB? Yes, but ensure sufficient current
- Should the "Panel mounted button switch" connect to the reset pin? Likely yes, as it's the only unused pin

**Pin Usage:**
- P1.22 and P1.23 are unused in the x5 config (though P1.23 is commented out for blue LED)
- The x5 has limited free pins due to hardware constraints

**Final Notes:**
- The wiring diagram for x4 may not apply to x5
- The x5 config already has P1.23 set for blue LED (commented out)
- The x5 doesn't have enough free pins due to hardware limitations

Thanks for your detailed questions! Let me know if you need clarification on any of these points.
