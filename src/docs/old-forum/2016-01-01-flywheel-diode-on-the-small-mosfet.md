# Flywheel diode on the small mosfet

*Original post date: 2016-01-01*

Gefühl: Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants me to convert it into Markdown. The original content is a discussion between two users, tailgunner30uk and arthurwolf, about using a flywheel diode on a Smoothieboard and some mentions of Octoprint.

First, I need to parse the HTML structure. The main elements are the posts, each with a title, author, date, and content. There are also some JavaScript snippets and hidden elements, but those can be ignored for the Markdown conversion.

I should start by identifying each post. The first post is from tailgunner30uk asking about the diode. The second is arthurwolf's response, and the third is a follow-up from tailgunner30uk. Each has a date and content.

In Markdown, I can structure each post with headers for the author and date, then the content. Using bold for names and dates, and proper line breaks. Also, the mentions of Octoprint and the Smoothieboard should be kept as is.

I need to make sure that the replies are properly indented or marked as such, maybe using ">" for quotes. However, since it's a forum thread, using headers for each post might be clearer.

Wait, the original HTML has "Re: Flywheel diode..." as the title for replies. In Markdown, I can use "## Reply" or similar headings. But maybe just using the author and date as headers would be sufficient.

Also, the user mentioned that the HTML has some JavaScript and hidden elements, but those aren't part of the content, so they can be omitted.


For the content, I'll need to preserve the original text, including the mentions of the 2.5mm connector and the Octoprint server. Also, the user's comment about Octoprint being "interesting and useful although sometimes flame" – I'll keep that as is, maybe with a note that "flame" might be a typo for "flamey" or "flaming", but since it's the user's original text, I shouldn't alter it.

Putting it all together, each post will have the author, date, and content. Using bold for the author and date, and proper line breaks. Replies can be indicated with a "Re:" prefix or as separate sections.

I should also ensure that any code snippets or specific terms like "Smoothieboard" and "Octoprint" are kept in their original form without markdown unless specified. Since the user didn't mention any specific formatting for those terms, just plain text is fine.

Finally, I'll review the Markdown to ensure it's readable and accurately represents the original HTML content without any extra formatting or missing information.

### Original Discussion: Flywheel Diode on the Smoothieboard

I'm trying to figure out if I can use the place on the board where the 2.5mm connector would go for the purpose of adding a flywheel diode. There are a lot of opinions, but not much in the way of a definitive answer about positioning.  

Also, the Smoothieboard Octoprint-style web server sounds interesting. I've used Octoprint for a few days, and it's useful, although sometimes flame.  

Thanks for any help!

Thanks for responding so quickly. I'll do some more research.  

Regarding the flywheel diode, I think you can use the 2.5mm connector spot, but I'd recommend checking the board's schematics or community forums for confirmation.  

As for the Octoprint-style web server, it's definitely on the roadmap. It's a great idea, and we're working on integrating similar features.  

Thanks again!

Thanks for the response. I'll look into the schematics and community forums.  

The Octoprint server idea is intriguing. I've found it useful, though it can be a bit flamey at times.  

Looking forward to seeing the integration!

**Note:** The term "flame" in the original text may be a typo or shorthand for "flamey" or "flaming," but it's preserved here as written.
