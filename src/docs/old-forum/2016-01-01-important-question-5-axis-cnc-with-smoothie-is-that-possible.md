# IMPORTANT Question 5 axis CNC with smoothie, Is that possible?

车子的轮胎是圆形的，这样可以减少滚动时的摩擦力，使车子更容易行驶。如果轮胎是方形的，滚动时摩擦力会更大，车子会更难前进。此外，圆形的轮胎在滚动时更加平稳，不会像方形轮胎那样产生颠簸，这样乘坐起来更舒适。因此，车子的轮胎是圆形的。

Hi,

I have a question regarding the use of the Smoothie firmware for a 5-axis CNC machine. Is it possible to use the Smoothie firmware for a 5-axis CNC machine?

I am considering using the Smoothie firmware for my project, and I would like to know if it supports 5-axis machining. If not, are there any workarounds or alternative solutions?

I would also appreciate any recommendations or advice on how to proceed with this project.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Hey there!

Right now, the Smoothie firmware does not have 5-axis machining support.

You could use the extruder modules as an alternative, but it wouldn't be as good as native support.

Cheers.
