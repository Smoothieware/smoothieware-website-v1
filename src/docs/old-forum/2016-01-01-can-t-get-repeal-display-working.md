Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants me to convert it into Markdown. The original content is a discussion between Matt Omond and Arthur about a problem with a display, specifically a Reprap display. Matt mentions flipping the connector, the contrast potentiometer burning, and plans to get a new one.

First, I need to parse the HTML structure. There are three posts: the initial problem by Matt, Arthur's response, and Matt's follow-up. Each post has a username, timestamp, and content. The HTML includes some JavaScript and template elements, but those can be ignored for the Markdown conversion.

I should structure the Markdown with headers for each post, using the usernames and timestamps as subheadings. The content of each post should be indented under their respective headers. Since it's a forum thread, using a numbered list or separate sections for each post makes sense. Also, need to make sure to preserve the quotes and the flow of the conversation. Check for any special characters that might need escaping, but in this case, it seems straightforward. Let me start converting each part step by step.

# Forum Thread: Can't Get Reprap Display Working

## Post by Matt Omond (05 Feb 2016 12:37)
You mentioned that you were having trouble with the Reprap display. You tried flipping the connector and adjusting the contrast potentiometer, but it fell off and started smoking. You plan to get a new one tomorrow.

## Response by Arthur (05 Feb 2016 11:21)
Arthur asked if the display was a clone and suggested that flipping the connector might be the solution. He also mentioned that the contrast potentiometer might need adjustment.

## Follow-up by Matt Omond (05 Feb 2016 12:37)
Matt confirmed that flipping the connector was the issue. However, while adjusting the contrast potentiometer, it fell off and emitted a burning smell. He intends to purchase a new one the next day.
