**Zprobe on servo**

Is there any way to control a servo with the Smoothieboard? I am having trouble finding any documentation on this. There are no 3 pin servo headers but one of the GPIO pins can be used for the signal wire, correct? Is this supported in firmware?

The reason I am asking is because I want to use a Z probe on a servo on my XY carriage.
