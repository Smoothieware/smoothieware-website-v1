How to pause immediately

hariantos 16 Jun 2015 11:25

Hi everyone,

I'd like to pause my print job **immediately** as soon as I press my pause button. I am using the switch function to pause my print job.

So far, M25, M600 and "suspend" command do not pause the print job **immediately**. I even tried to use M26 to abort, but same result. I had to keep pressing it a few times until it finally paused. It even sometimes completely skipped my pause.

I understand that the smoothieboard is waiting to empty its queue, so I also tried M112 but it completely crashed the smoothieboard and I had to restart the smoothieboard.

Is there a way to pause **directly/immediately** as soon as you press the button?

Many thanks in advance!
