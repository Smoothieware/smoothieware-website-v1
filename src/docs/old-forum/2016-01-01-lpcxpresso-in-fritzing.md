Where did you get the LPCXpresso component for Fritzing? I'm trying to find it but haven't had any luck.

You are not the first to ask.  
I had to make it by hand, it was an absolute pain, and I can't find a way to export it, the exported files always come out empty …  
If you contact me by email (arthurwolf@gmail.com) I can send you all the files I have, and you can see if you can do something with them.
