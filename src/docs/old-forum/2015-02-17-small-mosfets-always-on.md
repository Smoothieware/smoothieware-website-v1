**Small mosfets always on**  
by thomseal, 17 Feb 2015  

I purchased a Smoothie 3D printer and have been trying to get it to work. I've followed the setup instructions, but when I try to connect to the printer via USB, it doesn't show up in the list of available devices. I've checked the USB cable and port, and they seem fine. Any ideas on what might be causing this issue?

Hey.  

Mosfets always ON are probably a problem with the board.  

I recommend you contact whomever sold it to you (which could be me :) ) so they can help you figure out what's up.  

Cheers.
