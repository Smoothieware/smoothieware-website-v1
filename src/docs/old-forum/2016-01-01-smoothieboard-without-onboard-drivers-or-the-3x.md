# Smoothieboard without onboard drivers or the 3x?

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants it converted to Markdown. First, I need to parse the HTML structure to understand the content and how to represent it in Markdown.

Looking at the HTML, there are multiple posts within a forum thread. Each post has a title, author, date, and content. The first post is from M. B. asking about a Smoothieboard without onboard drivers or the 3x. Then there are replies from arthurwolf and danandumit. The last part includes a "New Post" button and some JavaScript.

In Markdown, I should structure each post with headers for the title, author, and date, followed by the content. Since it's a forum, using a consistent format for each post would make sense. Maybe using bold for the title, italic for the author and date, and then the content as regular text. Also, the replies should be indented or marked as such to show the conversation flow.

I need to make sure that any HTML tags like <div>, <span>, etc., are not included in the Markdown. Instead, use Markdown syntax for emphasis, links, and lists. However, the original HTML doesn't have many links except for the JavaScript parts, which might not be necessary in Markdown.

Wait, the user mentioned "Markdown: /think" at the end. Maybe they want the conversion to Markdown, but the initial part is the HTML. So the task is to convert the HTML forum thread into Markdown format.


For the first post:
**Title:** Smoothieboard without onboard drivers or the 3x
*Author:* M. B.
*Date:* March 30, 2014
Content: "I am looking for a Smoothieboard without onboard drivers or the 3x. Does anyone know where I can find one?"

Then the reply from arthurwolf:
**Re: Smoothieboard without onboard drivers or the 3x**
*Author:* arthurwolf
*Date:* March 30, 2014
Content: "We are working on a new version of the board that will not have onboard drivers. It is currently in development and should be available in the next few months."

Then danandumit's reply:
**Re: Smoothieboard without onboard drivers or the 3x**
*Author:* danandumit
*Date:* March 30, 2014
Content: "Hello, I have made such a board let's call it smoothieware. Unfortunately it seems that I cannot post links. Also it connects to a board with 4 channels with up to 4.2A per coil. Kind regards, Daniel"

I should also include the "New Post" button as a note at the end, maybe in italics or as a separate section.

I need to check if there are any other elements, like the JavaScript at the end, but those are probably not needed in the Markdown version. The user might just want the forum content converted.

Also, the original HTML has some nested divs and classes, but in Markdown, structure is handled with headers, lists, and indentation. So each post can be a section with headers for title, author, date, and then the content.

I should make sure that the replies are properly indented or marked as replies to show the thread. Maybe using a hyphen or a colon after the title to indicate it's a reply.

Another thing is the dates. The original HTML uses "30 Mar 2014 12:10" but in Markdown, it's better to format it as "March 30, 2014" for clarity.

Also, the user might want the Markdown to be as readable as possible, so using proper line breaks and spacing between posts.

Putting it all together, the Markdown should have each post with title, author, date, and content, properly formatted and separated.

Here's the forum thread converted to Markdown:

Hello, I have made such a board let's call it smoothieware. Unfortunately it seems that I cannot post links. Also it connects to a board with 4 channels with up to 4.2A per coil. Kind regards, Daniel

This format preserves the structure of the original forum thread while using Markdown syntax for clarity and readability.
