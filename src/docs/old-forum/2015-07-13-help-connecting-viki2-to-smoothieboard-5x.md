I'm very lost on how to connect a Viki2 to my Smoothieboard 5x. I see all the documentation on it but I cannot understand any of it. The documentation references the Azteeg X5 I can't understand what that has to do with the Smoothieboard.

"Viki2 wires to an Azteeg X5 mini with a flat cable as it has 1:1 pin mapping. The ConfigSample for the Azteeg mini has the config settings required, just uncomment them,"

Where do I actually plug all the wires into my Smoothieboard? Do I have to split up the IDE cable and wire them each to separate pins?
