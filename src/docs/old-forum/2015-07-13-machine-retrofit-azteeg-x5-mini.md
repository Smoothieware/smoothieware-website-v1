**Machine Retrofit Azteeg X5 Mini**

Hey everyone.  
I'm retrofiting a lab robot into a 3d printer using an Azteeg x5 mini v1.1.  
The robot has a conventional cartesian layout but the y axis motor stays fixed the chassis and moves the y axis via wire rope.  
This causes a unconventional mixing of axis motors used to move in X and Y.  
I am not sure what adjustments to make to have the printer run as intended.  
Please see attached photos, Any help will be appreciated.

Image showing motor rotations by axis movement for example:

- X+ equals X axis counter clockwise(CCW) + Y axis Clockwise(CW)
- CCW X2 equals Counter Clockwise at twice speed of the x axis motor
