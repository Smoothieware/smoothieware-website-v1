Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants it converted to Markdown. First, I need to parse the HTML structure and figure out how to represent it in Markdown.

Looking at the HTML, there's a forum thread with posts. Each post has a title, author, date, and content. The structure includes divs with classes like "post-container", "long", "short", etc. There are also buttons for actions like "Reply", "Edit", "Delete", and links to permalinks.

In Markdown, I can't directly represent HTML elements, but I can structure the content using headers, lists, and other Markdown syntax. The main challenge is to maintain the hierarchy and formatting of the original HTML while using Markdown.

First, I'll start with the title of the thread. The first post has the title "PLA cooling fans no longer working with new FW" by user code_123. Then there are replies from other users: arthurwolf and wolfmanjm. Each reply should be indented or marked as a reply.

I'll use headers for the main title and subheaders for each post. The content of each post can be in paragraphs. For the buttons and links, since Markdown doesn't support buttons, I can describe them as text or use links if applicable. However, the user might want to keep the structure as close as possible, so maybe using lists or bold text for the buttons.

Also, the dates and usernames should be formatted consistently. Maybe using italics for the dates and bold for the usernames. The replies can be indicated with "Re:" in the title.

I need to check if there are any specific elements that need special attention, like the "new-post" button, which should be mentioned at the end. The JavaScript at the end might not be necessary in Markdown, so I can ignore that part.

Putting it all together, the Markdown should have the main thread title, followed by each post with their respective content, authors, dates, and actions. Each reply should be nested under the main post, perhaps using indentation or dashes.

I should also ensure that the permalinks and other links are represented as clickable links in Markdown. However, the original HTML has placeholders like %POST_ID%, which might need to be replaced with actual IDs, but since the user hasn't provided them, I'll leave them as is or note that they're placeholders.

Finally, I'll review the Markdown to make sure it's readable and maintains the structure of the original HTML as much as possible within Markdown's capabilities.

### Notes:
- **Usernames** are linked as placeholders (e.g., `[code_123](#)`).
- **Dates** are formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` for consistency.
- **Actions** (Reply, Edit, Delete) are listed as bullet points.
- **Permalink template** is included as a reference.

This structure maintains the original hierarchy and key information while using Markdown syntax.
