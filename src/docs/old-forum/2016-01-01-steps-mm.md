# steps/mm

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants it converted to Markdown. First, I need to parse the HTML structure to understand the content and how to represent it in Markdown.

Looking at the HTML, there are several posts within a forum thread. Each post has a title, content, author, and timestamp. The first post is from Patrick Darrieulat asking about whether to use the exact value (179.5) or round it to 180 for the steps/mm setting. The second post by arthurwolf advises using the exact value. The third post is Patrick thanking him.

In Markdown, I should structure each post with headers for the title, the content, and then the author and timestamp. Since it's a forum, maybe using a numbered list for each post. Also, the user might want the replies nested under the original post, but in this case, the replies are separate posts, so each should be a separate entry.

I need to make sure to preserve the usernames and timestamps. Also, the "New Post" button at the end should be mentioned, perhaps as a note. The JavaScript at the end might not be necessary in Markdown, so I can ignore that.

Wait, the original HTML has some JavaScript variables like WIKIDOT.forumThreadId. Should that be included? Probably not, since it's just a script tag. The user probably wants the visible content converted, not the scripts.

So, the plan is to convert each post into a Markdown section with the title, content, author, and timestamp. Use headers for each post, maybe bold the usernames. Also, check for any special formatting in the text, but in this case, the text is plain.


First, the original post by Patrick:

**Title:** steps/mm

**Content:**  
Bonjour,  
je paramètre mon fichier .ini pour mon imprimante 3D.  
Je dois mettre la valeur de steps/mm pour l'axe X.  
La valeur calculée est de 179.5.  
Dois-je mettre 179.5 ou arrondir à 180 ?  
Merci d'avance.

**Author:** Patrick Darrieulat  
**Timestamp:** 11 Feb 2015 18:31

Then the reply from arthurwolf:

**Title:** Re: steps/mm

**Content:**  
Ok , merci bonne soirée

**Author:** Patrick Darrieulat  
**Timestamp:** 11 Feb 2015 18:31

Wait, no, the second post is from arthurwolf, and the third is Patrick's reply. Let me correct that.

Wait, looking back:

First post: Patrick asks about steps/mm (179.5 vs 180).

Second post: arthurwolf replies with "Ok , merci bonne soirée" — no, wait, no. Wait, the second post is from arthurwolf saying "Ok, merci bonne soirée"? No, no. Let me check again.

Wait, the first post is Patrick's initial question. The second post is arthurwolf's answer: "Ok , merci bonne soirée" — no, that's not right. Wait, no. Let me look again.
