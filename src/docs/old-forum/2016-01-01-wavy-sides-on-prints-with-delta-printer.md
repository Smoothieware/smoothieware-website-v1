# Wavy sides on prints with Delta printer

*Original post date: 2016-01-01*

dissolve the problem of wavy sides on prints with a delta printer, I need to analyze the information provided in the HTML content. The user is asking for a solution based on the forum discussion.

First, I'll look at the forum posts to understand the issue and the suggested solutions. The original poster (d) mentioned having a delta printer with wavy sides on prints, and they've done a calibration. The first response from arthurwolf suggests adjusting the acceleration and jerk settings in the printer's configuration. The second response from CrankyDon recommends using foam blocks between the arms to reduce vibrations and stiffening the corners to prevent lateral movement.

I need to present these solutions clearly, explaining each step and why it's important. I should also mention the importance of checking the printer's calibration and ensuring that the firmware is up to date. Additionally, I'll note that if the problem persists after trying these solutions, it might be necessary to consult the printer's manufacturer or seek further assistance from the community.

I should structure the answer in a logical order, starting with the most common solutions (adjusting settings, adding dampeners), then moving on to structural modifications (stiffening corners), and finally suggesting further steps if needed. It's important to use clear and concise language, avoiding technical jargon where possible, but still providing enough detail for the user to understand and implement the solutions.

To address the issue of wavy sides on prints with a delta printer, consider the following solutions based on the forum discussion:

### 1. **Adjust Printer Settings**
   - **Acceleration and Jerk Settings**: Modify the acceleration and jerk values in your printer's firmware configuration. Lowering these values can reduce vibrations during rapid movements, which may help smooth out the print surface.
   - **Firmware Update**: Ensure your printer's firmware is up to date. Manufacturers often release updates that improve performance and stability.

### 2. **Add Dampeners**
   - **Foam Blocks**: Place foam blocks between the parallel arms of the printer. This helps absorb vibrations and reduce oscillations during printing, which can contribute to wavy surfaces.

### 3. **Stiffen Structural Components**
   - **Corner Reinforcement**: Stiffen the corners of the printer's frame to prevent lateral (side-to-side) movement caused by the effector's motion. This can be done by adding bracing or using sturdier materials for the frame.

### 4. **Check Calibration**
   - **Re-Calibrate**: Even if you've already calibrated the printer, double-check the calibration process. Ensure that the endstop sensors are properly aligned and that the bed is level.

### 5. **Further Assistance**
   - If the issue persists after trying the above steps, consider reaching out to the printer's manufacturer or seeking further advice from the community. There may be additional factors specific to your printer's model or setup that require attention.

By systematically addressing these areas, you can mitigate the wavy sides issue and improve print quality.
