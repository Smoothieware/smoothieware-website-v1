_starts by analyzing the HTML structure to identify the main content sections, such as the forum thread and individual posts. It then extracts the relevant information, including the user names, dates, and content of each post. The assistant ensures that the markdown format is correctly applied, using headers for the thread title, bold for user names and dates, and proper paragraph formatting. It also checks for any hidden elements or scripts that might not be relevant to the final markdown output. Finally, it compiles all the extracted information into a coherent markdown document, maintaining the original structure and hierarchy of the forum thread._

You need to do all of the configuration in millimeters, you'll need to convert your values before giving them to Smoothie.

Then when using the board, giving inch values is fine if you put it into inch mode.
