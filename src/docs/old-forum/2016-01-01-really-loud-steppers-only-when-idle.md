# Really Loud Steppers Only When Idle

## User's Question

I'm using a XYZ Da Vinci printer that I'm modding with a Smoothieboard. The stepper motors are making a lot of noise when they're idle. I'm currently running the motors at 0.8A, but they have a 1.0A rating. How low can I go before they become too weak to function properly? I'm also running the same 12V as the last board.

The motors you have have a 1.0A rating, and you're running them at 0.8A right now. How low could you go before they become too weak to function properly? Also, you're running the same 12V as the last board. It is a XYZ Da Vinci printer that you're modding. I love the Smoothieboard, by the way.

You can try reducing the current to around 0.6A to see if that helps with the noise. However, you should be cautious not to go below that, as it might affect the performance of the motors. You can also try adjusting the voltage to see if that helps with the noise.
