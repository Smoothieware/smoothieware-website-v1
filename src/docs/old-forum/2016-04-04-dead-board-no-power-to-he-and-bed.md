# Dead Board? No power to HE and BED

I had a Rostock Max V2 with a Smoothieboard. The heatbed and hotend stopped working suddenly. The board still powers on, and the fans and stepper motors work. The terminal block for the big mosfet power melted. Had a spare when the heatbed terminal block melted a couple of months back.
