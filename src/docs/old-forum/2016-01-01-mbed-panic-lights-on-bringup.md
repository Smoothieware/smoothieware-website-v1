## Summary:
I'm trying to bring up smoothie on an mbed. Now I get the MBED blue light panic sequence. Any suggestions?

Additional info:  
I compiled under Linux, and moved the binary on to the MBED via USB.  
When I first brought up the board, I got a message on the serial terminal that it couldn't talk to the sdcard.  
I swapped some pins on the sdcard and the message went away, but nothing happened.  
I copied a config file onto the MBED USB and the sdcard. Now out of reset I get the mbed police car flashing light of doom sequence. There is no output on the serial terminal.

Any suggestions of how to proceed? I don't get a firmware version number and cannot type gcode commands (that I can tell)

Thanks,  
Ozz
