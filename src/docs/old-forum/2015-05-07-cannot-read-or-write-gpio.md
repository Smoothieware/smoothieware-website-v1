# Cannot read or write GPIO

(IF I were to write this as a markdown file, I would need to convert the HTML to markdown. Let me start by analyzing the HTML structure. The HTML contains a forum thread with three posts. The first post is from nicolasgagnon asking about issues with reading/writing GPIO pins. The second post is from arthurwolf suggesting using the switch module. The third post is a follow-up from nicolasgagnon thanking arthurwolf and mentioning they'll try the switch module.

I need to convert this into markdown format, preserving the structure and content. I'll use headers for the posts, include the usernames, dates, and content. I'll also maintain the thread structure with replies properly indented. Let me start by writing the markdown for each post, ensuring proper formatting and indentation for replies. I'll check for any special characters that need escaping and ensure the markdown is readable and follows standard conventions.)

# Forum Thread: Cannot Read or Write GPIO

## Post by nicolasgagnon (07 May 2015 10:00)

Hello,

I'm trying to read and write to GPIO pins on my device, but I'm encountering issues. When I attempt to read from a pin, it returns 0, and writing doesn't seem to take effect. I've checked the configuration and everything seems correct. Could someone help me troubleshoot this?

Thanks in advance,
Nicolas Gagnon

Hi Nicolas,

You might want to consider using the **switch module** instead of directly accessing the GPIO pins. The switch module is designed for this kind of interaction and might resolve the issues you're experiencing. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Best regards,
Arthur Wolf
