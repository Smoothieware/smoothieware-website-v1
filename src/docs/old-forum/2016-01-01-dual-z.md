# Dual Z-Axis Motor Wiring

**Tpete61** (26 Mar 2015 20:59)  
I'm trying to figure out the best way to wire two stepper motors for the Z-axis. Does anyone know if wiring them in series or parallel is better? Also, does it matter if the motors are wired to rotate in the same direction or opposite directions? I'm curious about how this affects torque and overall performance.

Hey!  
I think if you have two 1A steppers, wiring them in series would give you a 1A stepper, and in parallel would give you a 2A stepper.  
But I'm not 100% sure.  
Everybody uses parallel.
