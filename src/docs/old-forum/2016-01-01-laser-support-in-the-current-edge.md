# Laser support in the current Edge

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread discussing laser support in the current Edge. They also mentioned Markdown and asked for a response. My task is to figure out what they need.

First, I need to understand the context. The HTML shows a forum with three posts. The first user, de27, asked about laser support in Edge. wolfmanjm replied that there's a branch named 'laser' and invited testing. Fred27 then said they'll test it and get back to laser PPI.

The user might want this HTML converted into Markdown for documentation or sharing. Alternatively, they might want a summary of the discussion. Since they mentioned Markdown, maybe they want the content formatted that way.

Looking at the HTML structure, each post has a title, author, date, and content. Converting this into Markdown would involve using headers for titles, italics for usernames, and proper formatting for dates and links. Also, the JavaScript at the end might not be necessary in Markdown, so I can ignore that.

I should check if there are any specific elements to highlight, like the branch name 'laser' or the mention of PPI. Ensuring that the Markdown is readable and preserves the structure of the forum thread is important. Maybe using bullet points for each post and bold for the usernames.

Wait, the user might also want the code block converted, but the original HTML is already provided. Maybe they want the content extracted into a more readable format. Let me structure each post with headers, authors, dates, and content, using appropriate Markdown syntax.

Also, note that the original HTML has some JavaScript variables, but those are probably not needed in the Markdown version. Focus on the textual content of the posts. Make sure to mention the branch name and the testing invitation clearly.

I think that's it. Now, structure the Markdown with each post as a section, using headers, italics for usernames, and proper formatting for dates and links. Ensure clarity and readability.
