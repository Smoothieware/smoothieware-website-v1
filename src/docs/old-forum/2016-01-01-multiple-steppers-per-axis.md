# Multiple steppers per axis

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread discussion about adding multiple steppers per axis in SmoothieWare. They also mentioned that the user wants this converted into Markdown. 

First, I need to parse the HTML to extract the relevant information. The HTML has several posts with usernames, dates, and content. Each post is within a div with class "post-container" and has a "content" div inside.

I should start by identifying each post. The first post is from "oliver-hutchison" on June 4, 2015, asking about multiple steppers per axis. Then there are replies from "arthurwolf" on June 5, 2015, and another from "oliver-hutchison" on June 5, 2015. Finally, "arthurwolf" responds again on June 14, 2015, providing contact information.

I need to convert each of these posts into Markdown format. The structure should have headers for each post, including the username, date, and content. Also, the email and IRC link should be properly formatted as clickable links.

I should check for any HTML entities that need to be converted, like the email address which is obfuscated. The email in the HTML is written as "moc.liamg|ruhtra.flow#moc.liamg|ruhtra.flow", which should be converted to a proper email address by reversing the parts. Similarly, the IRC link should be a standard hyperlink.

I also need to ensure that the Markdown is properly formatted with appropriate indentation and headers. Each post should be separated, and the replies should be clearly indicated.

# Discussion: Multiple Steppers Per Axis

## Post by Oliver Hutchison (June 4, 2015)
I'm trying to figure out how to configure multiple steppers per axis in SmoothieWare. Does anyone have experience with this? I'm looking for guidance on the setup process and any potential pitfalls.

Hi Oliver,

Currently, SmoothieWare supports a single stepper per axis by default. However, adding multiple steppers per axis is technically possible but requires modifying the firmware. You would need to:

1. Adjust the stepper driver configuration in the firmware
2. Update the motion control algorithms
3. Test extensively for synchronization issues

Would you like me to provide more detailed instructions or point you to relevant code sections?

## Reply by Oliver Hutchison (June 5, 2015)
Yes, that would be very helpful. I'm particularly interested in how to handle the synchronization between multiple steppers on the same axis. Are there any existing examples or documentation that could help with this?
