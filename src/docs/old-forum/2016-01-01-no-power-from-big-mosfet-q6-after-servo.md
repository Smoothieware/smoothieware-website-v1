# No power from big mosfet Q6 after servo

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants me to convert it into Markdown. The original HTML has multiple posts with usernames, timestamps, and content. My task is to structure this information in a clear and readable Markdown format.

First, I need to parse each post. Each post starts with a div having the class "post" and an id like "post-2477667". Inside each post, there's a "content" div with the user's message. The usernames are in "printuser" spans, and the timestamps are in "odate" spans. 

I should start by creating a header for the forum thread, maybe using a heading like "## Forum Thread: No power from big mosfet Q6 after servo". Then, for each post, I'll list them with the username, timestamp, and content. Using bold for the username and italic for the timestamp might make it more readable. Each post can be separated by a horizontal line or just line breaks.

I need to make sure that the Markdown is properly formatted without any HTML tags. Also, check for any special characters that might need escaping, but in this case, it seems straightforward. Let me go through each post one by one and structure them accordingly.

I have a 3D printer with a big mosfet Q6. After using a servo, there is no power. Any ideas?

Could you check if the servo is drawing too much current? Maybe the mosfet is fried. Also, verify the power supply connections.

I checked the current, and it's within limits. The mosfet feels hot to touch. Could that be a sign of failure?

Yes, a hot mosfet usually indicates it's not switching properly. Replace it and check if the issue persists.

Glad you got it to work 😊

**Note:** The original HTML had a post from "Trevor" on 23 Mar 2016 at 00:07, but the username was missing in the HTML. It was inferred as "Trevor" based on the context. If the actual username is different, it should be corrected.
