## Random Halt... Need Logging  
**Posted by:** brotherbrown831 | **Date:** 16 Aug 2016 00:22  

I've had 10 successful prints using my Smoothieboard (firmware 1.15.1) with a 3D printer. However, on the 11th print, it halted randomly during the print. I've checked all connections, power supply, and even swapped out the SD card, but the issue persists. Any ideas on what could be causing this?

There is no logging to SD; you'll need to be connected via USB to get the message. Please try that.
