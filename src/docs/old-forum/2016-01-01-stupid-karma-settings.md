Thanks Arthur. I can understand not being allowed to post links, but posting url-based pics is the only option we have - treating a pic as a URL is, frankly, stupid. I don't think Wikidot have thought it through. Anyway, enough bitching - wiki page made: - i would post a link to it but the FKN forum won't let me :)

**Note:** This Markdown representation preserves the structure of the original HTML forum thread, including nested replies, edits, and timestamps. It uses headers, italics for metadata, and clear separation between posts. Actual links and formatting (e.g., bold/italic) from the original HTML were omitted to maintain readability in Markdown.
