**Hello everybody !**

The Smoothie project is organizing a contest in which you have the opportunity to participate in a great Open-Source project, and to **win a Smoothieboard.**

## What’s a Smoothie ?

The [Smoothie project’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20150918223511/http://smoothieware.org/) objective is to design a [controller board](https://web.archive.org/web/20150918223511/http://smoothieware.org/smoothieboard) and associated firmware, with the following goals: all Open-Source, simple to use and configure, using powerful hardware, feature-rich, and contributor-friendly.

We want to showcase the fact that the Firmware is particularly easy to contribute to and add things to, that’s why we are doing this contest.

## How does the contest work ?

You enter the contest by presenting an idea for a project. Note, you don’t need to actually do the㉿ project idea.

## Where can I learn more ?

There is a website at [http://smoothiecontest.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20150918223511/http://smoothiecontest.org), with project ideas to help inspire you, all of the contests’ rules, and a list of the contest entries so far.

You can also email me directly at [arthurwolf@gmail.com](mailto:arthurwolf@gmail.com) if you have any question.

Cheers all, can’t wait to see what kind of stuff you’ll propose !
