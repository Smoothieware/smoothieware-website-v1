I have a GLCD panel from [this link](https://www.ebay.com/itm/262232734589). I've connected it to my RAMPS 1.4 board, but the screen is blank. I've tried connecting the 5V and GND, and the backlight works, but no display. I've checked the wiring multiple times and it seems correct. Any help?

I don't have a potentiometer on my GLCD panel. I connected it to 5V and GND, and it worked. Maybe your panel requires a potentiometer for contrast adjustment? I used a 10k ohm potentiometer between VCC and GND, and connected the middle pin to the contrast pin on the GLCD. Let me know if that helps!

@DavidPosea, I don't have a potentiometer either. I tried connecting the contrast pin to 5V and GND directly, but no luck. The backlight works, but the screen remains blank. Could there be a problem with the panel itself?

@DarrenAnton, I think the panel might be defective. I ordered a replacement from the same seller, and it worked immediately. Maybe yours is faulty. Let me know if you want the seller's details.
