Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML and JavaScript code from a forum thread discussion about issues with Smoothie firmware and S3D software. They want me to analyze this and provide a summary or explanation. 

First, I need to understand the context. The forum thread is about a problem where the Smoothie firmware is causing prints to stop when using S3D's G-code files. Users are discussing the issue, and there's some back-and-forth between the user 'arthurwolf' and another user 'xtal'.

Looking at the HTML, it's a forum thread with multiple posts. The first post by 'arthurwolf' mentions that S3D's G-code files are causing the Smoothie firmware to choke, leading to print failures. He also criticizes S3D's support, mentioning that they denied the problem, censored users, and were uncooperative.

The second post by 'xtal' points out that the problem might be with S3D's G-code generation, suggesting that residual moves in high-detail prints could be the cause. He notes that other slicers like Cura and Slic3r don't have this issue, and that 8-bit firmwares aren't affected because they're slower.

In the third post, 'arthurwolf' responds to 'xtal', agreeing that the issue is likely S3D's G-code but emphasizing that fixing it on their end is easier than on Smoothie's. He also mentions that S3D's support has been unhelpful and hostile.

Now, the user wants a summary or analysis of this discussion. They might be looking for an explanation of the technical issue, the nature of the support interaction, or the possible solutions. 

I should break down the key points: the technical problem with G-code, the user experience with S3D's support, and the possible reasons why S3D's G-code is causing issues. Also, note that the community is trying to resolve it but facing challenges with S3D's cooperation.

I need to make sure the summary is clear, concise, and covers both the technical aspects and the interpersonal issues mentioned in the forum thread. Also, check if there are any specific terms or concepts that need explaining, like "residual moves" or why 8-bit firmwares aren't affected. 

Wait, the user might also want to know the possible solutions or next steps. 'arthurwolf' mentions that fixing it on S3D's side is easier, so maybe suggesting that users switch slicers or that S3D should address their G-code generation.

I should structure the answer into sections: Problem Description, Technical Analysis, Support Interaction, Possible Solutions. That way, it's organized and easy to follow. Also, highlight the key points from each post to ensure nothing important is missed.

### Summary of the Forum Discussion: Smoothie Firmware and S3D G-code Issues

#### **1. Problem Description**
Users are encountering issues where **Smoothie firmware** (used in 3D printers) **crashes or stops mid-print** when processing G-code files generated by **S3D (Slic3r PE)**. This problem does not occur with other slicers like **Cura** or **Slic3r**, nor with older 8-bit firmwares. The issue is specific to high-detail prints, where S3D's G-code may contain **"residual moves"**—tiny, unnecessary movements that overwhelm the Smoothie firmware's processing capabilities.

---

#### **2. Technical Analysis**
- **Root Cause Hypothesis**: 
  - S3D's G-code generation may leave **insanely small residual moves** for high-detail prints. These moves are not present in other slicers, which avoid such issues by design.
  - Older 8-bit firmwares are unaffected because they are too slow to "choke" on these residual moves, whereas Smoothie's faster processing exposes the problem.
- **Impact**: 
  - The residual moves cause the Smoothie firmware to crash or halt the print, leading to failed prints.
  - This is not a bug in Smoothie but a result of S3D's G-code output.

---

#### **3. Support Interaction with S3D**
- **User Experience**: 
  - **S3D's response** has been criticized as **uncooperative and hostile**. 
  - They initially **denied the problem**, refused to provide licenses for debugging, and **censored users** reporting the issue on their forum.
  - The community perceives S3D's support as **unfriendly and unhelpful**, despite the software's popularity.
- **Community Efforts**: 
  - The Smoothie team (represented by user **arthurwolf**) is actively working to debug the issue but faces **delays** due to missing tools and S3D's lack of collaboration.
  - Fixing the issue on S3D's side is deemed **easier** than modifying Smoothie's firmware.

---

#### **4. Possible Solutions**
- **Short-Term Workarounds**:
  - Users are advised to **switch to slicers like Cura or Slic3r** (non-S3D versions) to avoid the issue.
  - Ensure S3D's G-code is **cleaned up** (e.g., using post-processing tools) to remove residual moves.
- **Long-Term Fixes**:
  - **S3D** should address their G-code generation to eliminate residual moves, which would resolve compatibility with Smoothie and other firmwares.
  - **Improved collaboration** between S3D and the Smoothie community could expedite fixes.

---

#### **Key Takeaways**
- The issue stems from **S3D's G-code output**, not Smoothie's firmware.
- S3D's support has been **uncooperative**, hindering resolution efforts.
- The community is working on a fix, but **S3D's involvement** is critical for a permanent solution.
- Users are encouraged to **use alternative slicers** in the meantime.
