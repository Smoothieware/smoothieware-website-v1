# Use of Servos with a Smoothieboard

## Post by brian2000 (13 May 2015 01:52)
I have a Smoothieboard 5X and I'm trying to use it with a GeckoDrive G320X driver and a DC NEMA 23 servo with encoder. I've been trying to get it to work for a few days now and I can't get past the point where the motor just spins and doesn't stop. I've tried different configurations in the firmware and I've checked all the connections multiple times. I'm starting to think that maybe the driver is not compatible with the Smoothieboard. Does anyone have any experience with this combination?

I too am going to use GeckoDrive G320X drivers on the SB but I want to be 100 percent on hooking them up and what I have to change in the config to make them work right. I'll be using DC NEMA 23 servo's with encoders.

Also while on this subject is it at all possible to sync two servo's to run on the same axis? I would think that one or both the motors would need to be trimmed in every so often?

I have an idea of how to do it all but I would rather be safe than sorry since the 5X seems to be out of stock almost everywhere now days. It's to bad someone hasn't made a video on YouTube about how to hook things up for the different applications and how to configure the firmware for each of the application, I think that alone would clear up a lot of questions people have on here and save everyone time. Who's game? lol
