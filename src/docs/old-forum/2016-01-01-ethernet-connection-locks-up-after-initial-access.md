# Ethernet connection locks up after initial access

Okay, let's see. The user provided a block of HTML code from a forum thread and wants me to convert it into Markdown. The main challenge here is to accurately represent the structure and content of the forum posts in Markdown format.

First, I need to parse the HTML to identify the different elements. There are multiple posts with usernames, timestamps, and content. Each post has a title, author, time, and message. The HTML uses divs with classes like "post" and "content" to structure the information.

I should start by creating a header for the forum thread, maybe using a heading like "Ethernet Connection Locks Up After Initial Access". Then, for each post, I'll use a combination of bold text for the username and timestamp, followed by the content. Since Markdown doesn't support HTML tags, I'll need to use appropriate Markdown syntax like **bold** for emphasis and > for blockquotes if needed.

Looking at the first post by KarloDamian, the content mentions the Ethernet connection issue. The second post by arthurwolf asks a question, and the third response from KarloDamian provides more details. The fourth post from arthurwolf suggests that the SD card interfaces might be experimental.

I need to ensure that each post is clearly separated, perhaps using a horizontal rule (---) between them. Also, the timestamps should be formatted consistently, maybe as "09 Oct 2016 20:23".

I should check for any special characters or formatting in the original HTML that need to be preserved in Markdown. For example, the word "Ethernet" is in a link, so I'll need to convert that into a Markdown link if possible. However, the original HTML might not have proper link syntax, so I might just keep it as plain text unless there's a clear URL.

Another thing to note is the use of "Re: " in the post titles, which indicates a reply. In Markdown, I can use a colon to denote that, like "Re: Ethernet Connection Locks Up After Initial Access".

I also need to handle the "New Post" button and other interface elements, but since the user is asking for the content of the forum thread, those might be omitted unless specified. The focus is on the actual posts.

Finally, I'll review the converted Markdown to ensure that all posts are correctly formatted, the structure is logical, and the information is accurately represented without any HTML tags.

Hello,  
I'm experiencing an issue where the Ethernet connection locks up after the initial access. Could someone please help me troubleshoot this?

Could you clarify what you mean by "locks up"? Are you referring to the connection dropping, or the interface becoming unresponsive?

When I first connect via Ethernet, everything works fine. However, after a few minutes, the connection becomes unresponsive. I have to restart the device to get it working again. This happens consistently.

That is strange. The SD card interfaces are experimental, maybe you are running into a weird issue with them. We will try to update them at some point, when that happens maybe you can try them again and see if it works better.

Additionally, the issue only occurs when using the SD card interfaces. The integrated Ethernet port works without any problems.
