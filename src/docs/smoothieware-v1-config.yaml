    description: Default acceleration for all axes in mm/s². This is the rate at which the machine accelerates and decelerates
      during moves. Higher acceleration values allow faster speed changes and shorter move times, but may cause ringing, layer
      shifts, or mechanical stress. Lower values provide smoother operation at the cost of speed. This setting can be overridden
      per-axis using the per-actuator acceleration settings.
    description_bullets:
    - This is a global default that applies to all axes unless specifically overridden
    - Per-axis acceleration settings (in actuator configuration) take precedence over this value
    - Z-axis often benefits from lower acceleration than XY to prevent layer artifacts
    - Delta printers typically need lower acceleration due to complex kinematics

      during normal operations (cutting, extruding, or engraving). The value is specified in millimeters per minute and serves
      as a fallback when G-code doesn't explicitly set a feed rate. Once an F parameter is specified in G-code, that rate
      persists until changed.
    description_bullets:
    - This is only used when G-code omits the F parameter
    - Most slicers and CAM software specify F in every move, making this rarely used

      between points. This rate should typically be faster than feed rate, limited only by mechanical capabilities and max_speeds.
    description_bullets:
    - G0 moves are for rapid positioning, not working moves

    description: Maximum allowable speed for the Z axis. Smoothie will never exceed this value for Z axis movement regardless
      of requested feed rate. Typically much slower than X/Y because Z-axis uses leadscrew drives with higher mechanical advantage
      and less need for speed. For delta printers, all three actuators contribute to Z motion so this should be set higher.
      The value is specified in mm/min but converted internally to mm/s for calculations.
    description_bullets:
    - Z-axis is typically much slower than XY due to leadscrew mechanics
    - Default of 300 mm/min (5 mm/s) is appropriate for most Cartesian machines
    - Delta printers need much higher values (6000+ mm/min) as all towers move for Z
    - Layer change speed in 3D printing is limited by this setting

    description: Global maximum speed limit applied to all moves. When set to a positive value, limits the combined speed
      of all axes (the magnitude of the velocity vector). When negative, this limit is disabled and only per-axis max_speeds
      apply. This is useful for machines where the combined motion speed matters more than individual axis speeds, such as
      delta printers or when total kinetic energy is a concern.
    description_bullets:
    - Negative value (default) disables this limit
    - When enabled, applies to the vector magnitude of the move
    - Applies in addition to per-axis limits (the more restrictive limit wins)
    - Most Cartesian/CoreXY machines leave this disabled (-1)

    description: Specific acceleration for Z axis movements. When set to a valid number, overrides the default acceleration
      setting for Z axis only. When set to NAN (not a number) or omitted, the Z axis uses the global default acceleration.
      This is useful for providing slower/safer Z acceleration without affecting XY speed, particularly important for preventing
      layer artifacts in 3D printing or Z-axis backlash issues in CNC.
    description_bullets:
    - When NAN or unset, Z uses the global default acceleration
    - Z-axis typically benefits from lower acceleration than XY
    - Lower Z acceleration reduces layer start artifacts in 3D printing
    - Helps prevent Z-axis binding or leadscrew whip

    description: Junction deviation controls cornering speed by defining how much the tool path can deviate from a perfect
      corner. This replaces traditional "jerk" settings with a more mathematically sound approach. Higher values allow faster
      cornering but with less precision and potential corner rounding. Lower values ensure precision but require the machine
      to slow down more at corners. The optimal value depends on mechanical rigidity, desired print quality, and acceptable
      path deviation.
    description_bullets:
    - This is Smoothie's replacement for traditional jerk settings
    - Lower values = slower corners, more precise path following
    - Higher values = faster corners, slight path rounding
    - 0.05mm default balances speed and quality for most machines
    - Increase for faster prints with acceptable quality loss
    - Decrease for high-precision work or weak mechanical systems
    - Too high causes corner bulging in 3D prints or path errors in CNC

    description: Separate junction deviation for Z axis. When set to a valid number, allows different cornering behavior for
      moves involving Z-axis motion. When set to NAN (default), Z-axis uses the global junction_deviation value. This is useful
      for preventing Z artifacts in 3D printing by forcing the nozzle to come to a complete stop at layer changes, or for
      CNC operations where Z precision is more critical than XY precision.
    description_bullets:
    - When NAN, Z uses the global junction_deviation setting
    - Set to 0.0 to force full stops at all Z direction changes
    - Useful for eliminating Z-seam artifacts in 3D printing
    - Important for CNC when Z precision matters more than speed
    - May increase print time as machine stops at layer changes

      prevent stepper motor stalling at very low speeds but may affect corner quality.
    description_bullets:

    - Useful for preventing stepper stalls on machines with poor low-speed torque

      to a non-zero value, overrides mm_per_line_segment for calculating segment length. The segment length is computed as
      (move_speed / segments_per_second). This ensures consistent segmentation regardless of move speed, with faster moves
      getting longer segments and slower moves getting shorter segments, maintaining the target segment rate.
    description_bullets:
    - Only used for delta kinematics
    - When set, overrides mm_per_line_segment calculation
    - Segment length = move_speed / segments_per_second
    - 100-200 segments/sec typical for deltas
    - Higher values = more frequent kinematics calculations = smoother but more CPU
    - Lower values = less CPU but potentially less smooth motion
    - Set to 0 to use mm_per_line_segment instead

      Also known as "tickle power" or "keepalive power" in some contexts. When proportional power is enabled, the laser uses
      this power level during G0 (rapid) travel moves. During cutting operations, the actual power is scaled between this
      minimum and the maximum power setting.

    description_bullets:
    - 'When `false` (default): X and Y home first (simultaneously), then Z homes'
    - 'When `true`: Z homes first, then X and Y home (simultaneously)'
    - Homing Z first is useful for machines with auto bed leveling probes that need Z clearance before XY movement
    - Also useful for gantries that could crash into bed features without Z clearance
    - Moving beds may need Z in a safe position before XY homing
    - Does not affect individual axis homing (e.g., G28 Z still homes only Z)
    - Only affects G28 with no parameters or G28 with multiple axes specified
    - Ignored if `homing_order` is specified (homing_order takes precedence)
    - Not applicable to delta machines (they always home all axes together in Z-only mode)
    - Not applicable to CoreXY (it homes axes individually anyway due to `corexy_homing`)
    - Z-axis typically homes slower for safety regardless of whether it homes first or last

    - Not valid for delta or rotary delta machines (ignored, deltas must home all together)
    - Not valid for CoreXY (already homes individually due to `corexy_homing`)
    - If an axis doesn't have an endstop defined, homing will fail when it tries to home that axis

    description: Enables the panel interface module. Panels provide a screen, an encoder wheel and/or a set of buttons, used
      to control your machine without requiring a computer connection. When enabled, the panel module initializes the LCD
      driver, configures input devices, and registers for system events to display machine status and accept user input.
    description_bullets:
    - Multiple panel types are supported through the `panel.lcd` setting.
    - If disabled or not configured, the panel module is completely removed from memory.
    - The panel provides standalone machine control including file selection, temperature adjustment, manual jogging, and
      G-code execution.

    description: Specifies the type of panel connected to the Smoothieboard. Each panel has a specific interface and driver
      requirements, so the correct panel type must be specified. The value determines which panel driver will be loaded and
      initialized. Different panels have different pin requirements, button configurations, and display capabilities.
    description_bullets:
    - The panel type selection affects which other settings are required or optional.
    - RRD GLCD does not support SPI CS pin sharing and requires dedicated SPI port.
    - OLED displays (SSD1306, SH1106) require additional A0 and RST pins for initialization.
    - Viki2 panels support red/blue LED indicators for heating status.
    - Universal Adapter supports daisy-chaining multiple devices via busy pin polling.

      pin assignments. Channel selection affects which physical pins are used for MOSI (Master Out Slave In), MISO (Master
      In Slave Out), and SCLK (Serial Clock) signals. Most panels use channel 0 by default.
    description_bullets:
    - Channel 0 is the default and most commonly used SPI channel.
    - Channel 1 can be used if channel 0 is needed for other devices.
    - Both panel and external SD card can share the same SPI channel with different CS pins.
    - Consult the Smoothieboard pinout diagram to identify available SPI pins.

      commands; when high (inactive), the panel ignores SPI traffic.
    description_bullets:
    - 'CRITICAL: RepRap Discount GLCD does not support CS and requires being alone on its SPI port.'
    - ST7565 panels typically use pin 0.16 as default.
    - Each device on the SPI bus must have a unique CS pin.

      updates and more responsive display refresh, but may cause communication errors if the panel cannot keep up with the
      data rate. The optimal frequency depends on the panel type, cable quality, and cable length.
    description_bullets:

    - Higher frequencies (2-4 MHz) can improve refresh rate on fast panels.
    - Lower frequencies (500 kHz) may be needed for long cables or noisy environments.

      making text lighter/less visible. Optimal value depends on viewing angle, ambient lighting conditions, and panel characteristics.
    description_bullets:
    - Only applicable to panels with contrast control hardware (not RRD GLCD).
    - Different panel types have different optimal contrast ranges.
    - Contrast may need adjustment based on room lighting and viewing angle.

    description: Configures the number of lines to offset the menu lines by on screen, effectively controlling how many encoder
      clicks are required to move one menu position. When set to 1, the encoder requires 2 clicks to move one menu line, which
      is useful for high-resolution encoders that have more detents per revolution. This setting helps adapt encoder sensitivity
      to user preference and encoder hardware characteristics.
    description_bullets:
    - On some panels, this value must be set to 1 for proper operation with high-resolution encoders.
    - Setting to 1 provides finer control and reduces accidental menu skipping.
    - Setting to 0 provides faster menu navigation with fewer encoder turns required.
    - This is an end-user usability setting that depends on encoder hardware and personal preference.

    description: Specifies the A pin for the rotary encoder wheel. Encoders have two output pins (A and B) that generate quadrature
      signals as the encoder is rotated. The firmware reads both pins to determine rotation direction and count encoder pulses.
      The `^` modifier defines menu move direction (when used, inverts the default direction). The `!` modifier inverts the
      signal polarity.
    description_bullets:
    - Encoders require both A and B pins to be configured for proper operation.
    - Set to `nc` if you use no encoder (button-only panel navigation).
    - The `^` pull-up modifier is recommended for reliable encoder reading.
    - Encoder pins must support high-speed input reading (avoid slow I2C-based pins).

      to determine rotation direction and count encoder pulses. The `^` modifier defines menu move direction (when used, inverts
      the default direction). The `!` modifier inverts the signal polarity.

    - Set to `nc` if you use no encoder (button-only panel navigation).
    - The `^` pull-up modifier is recommended for reliable encoder reading.
    - Encoder B pin must be on the same port as encoder A pin on some hardware.

    description: Specifies the number of pulses the encoder emits per physical detent (click position). This value is used
      to convert raw encoder pulse counts into meaningful menu navigation clicks. Standard encoders typically emit 2 or 4
      pulses per detent. Setting this correctly ensures that each encoder click moves the menu by exactly one position.
    description_bullets:
    - Default value is typically 2 for standard 20-detent encoders.
    - High-resolution encoders may use 4 pulses per detent.
    - Incorrect value causes menu to skip positions or require multiple clicks per movement.
    - Some panels override this value based on their specific encoder hardware.
    - This setting is independent of `menu_offset` which provides additional click multiplication.

    description_bullets:
    - The click button is the primary selection mechanism for menu navigation.
    - Most encoder wheels have an integrated click button activated by pressing the encoder shaft.
    - Active-low buttons (ground when pressed) require the `!` modifier.
