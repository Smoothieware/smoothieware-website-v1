  <strong>Forum posting guidelines</strong><br><br>
  Here are a few tips for those creating a new forum thread:
  <ul>
    <li>If you do not get an answer in the forum, maybe try the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/smoothieware-support">support mailing list</a> and <a href="irc">IRC channel</a>. Please, if you post a question here, then go to IRC where it is answered immediately, come back here to delete the post so that somebody doesn't answer it here for nothing.</li>
    <li>Please put: <code>[[details="config.txt"]]Your config file's content[[/details]]</code> around your copy/pasted configuration files, or any other large file, it makes them much easier to read. Please post your configuration file if you think it has any chance of being relevant.</li>
  </ul>
