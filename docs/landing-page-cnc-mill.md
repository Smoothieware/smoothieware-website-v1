## Upgrading or Building a CNC Mill?

### Common Controller Problems:

- ❌ **GRBL Memory Constraints** - 2KB RAM limits motion planning buffer depth; documented "out of program storage space" errors with complex toolpaths
- ❌ **Limited to 3-Axis** - Many budget controllers lack native 4-axis or 5-axis support
- ❌ **Expensive Commercial Options** - LinuxCNC setups cost $800+ (PC + cards), commercial controllers $1000-3000
- ❌ **Parallel Port Complexity** - LinuxCNC requires dedicated PC, HAL configuration files, driver troubleshooting
- ❌ **Configuration Difficulty** - GRBL requires firmware recompilation for many changes; commercial controllers have proprietary interfaces

**For Production-Quality Results on Hobby/Small Shop Budget:**

You need:
- Sufficient processing power (handle complex toolpaths)
- Reliability (can't crash mid-aluminum cut)
- Expandability (probes, tool changers, multi-axis)
- Affordability (not $1000+)

**Smoothieboard v2 delivers all of this at $200.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can Smoothie handle rigid tapping?**

A: No, not natively. Smoothie is excellent for general milling but doesn't support synchronized rigid tapping. Use floating tap holders instead.

**Q: Will it work with my VFD spindle?**

A: Yes. Smoothie provides PWM output or relay control that can interface with most VFDs via their analog or digital inputs.

**Q: Is it powerful enough for aluminum milling?**

A: Absolutely. The 32-bit processor is more than capable. Motion is smooth and reliable. Proven in aluminum production work by small shops.

**Q: Can I add a 4th axis later?**

A: Yes. Just add the configuration for the A-axis when you're ready. No firmware recompilation needed.

**Q: How does it compare to Mach3/Mach4?**

A: Smoothie is open-source and standalone (no PC needed). Mach3/4 require a Windows PC and specific motion controllers. For hobby/small shop use, Smoothie offers better value and simpler setup.
