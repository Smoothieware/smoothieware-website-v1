# M24: Start/Resume SD Print

Issuing an **M24** causes the file selected with the M23 command to be printed. If the print was previously paused with M25, printing is resumed from that point. To restart a file from the beginning, use M23 to reset it, then M24.
When this command is used to resume a print that was paused, Smoothieware runs macro file `resume.g` prior to resuming the print.

> [!NOTE]
> **Print:** Refers to running a job on any Smoothie attached device such as 3D printer, Laser engraver/cutter, CNC router etc.
