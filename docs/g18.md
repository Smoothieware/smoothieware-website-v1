# G18 G-code

G18 means "all commands are now to be interpreted in the XZ plane".

This command essentially changes the meaning (or plane) of the `I`, `J`, and `K` parameters of the [G2](g2) and [G3](g3) G-codes.

Smoothie starts in the G17 mode (the default plane is the XY plane). You can change this with the [G18](g18) or [G19](g19) commands, and you can come back to the "normal" plane with the [G17](g17) command.

This command is modal, meaning that once it is executed, all Gcodes after it are now in this now "mode", until changed by another mode-changing Gcode of its family.

## Format

The command is used as such:

```
G18
```

Which means: `G2` and `G3` commands are now in the XZ plane.

## Parameters

No parameters.
