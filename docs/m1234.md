# M20 M-code

**M20** is a member of a class of M-codes which are used to access and manage the contents of the connected Smoothie's **SD Card**

Issuing an **M20** causes the contents of Smoothie's SD card to be output to its serial port.
A properly connected host will in turn receive and display the Smoothie's SD card directory to its console.

To verify and debug your Smoothie's serial connection try this: [debug:computer-sees-board](http://smoothieware.org/debug:computer-sees-board.md)

## Format

The command is used as such:

```
M20 [S] [P]
```

**What it does:** Outputs contents of SD card to serial port while using `S` to define the format and `P` defines the directory to list.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Usage | Example |
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| `S` | Style: Defines the format used to present the output | M20 S0 |
| `P` | Directory: Defines the directory that will be listed | M20 |

## Smoothie supported parameter values

The `S` parameter when used with Smoothie supports Style 0 only, which is the default. If you do not include `S` it will assume `S0`.
The `P` parameter is not supported by Smoothie. Smoothie defaults to the SD card's root directory.

If your SD card contents were:
- config.txt
- firmware.cur
- Readme.txt
- myGgcode.gcode

This means if you command:

```
M0 S0
```
or
```
M0 S0 P1
```
or
```
M0 S1 P1
```
or
```
M0 P2
```

...they will all print the following to the connected console:
```
Ok
config.txt
firmware.cur
Readme.txt
myGgcode.gcode
```

## Modal use

The M0 command is not modal.
