## Before You Ask

- **Please read the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting) section** before you ask for help, in case your question is answered there.

- A lot of questions have already been asked in the past. It might be worth it searching the forum for an answer to your question. The wiki may also have the answer you are searching for.

- Before posting about your problem, please make sure you are using the latest firmware and config, as well as the latest version of your host software.

## When Posting Your Question

- **Please mention your board type, OS, machine type, and any other useful information.**

- **Always include your configuration file.** It's likely if you don't post your configuration file, you will be asked for it, so save everyone (including you) some time and just post your config file right away with your first post.

- **NEVER paste the config directly in the forum.** Instead, paste it to [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com), and share the link in the forum. This keeps posts clean and readable.

- If your problem has anything to do with files or config not being taken into account, please format your [SD card](sd-card), start with a fresh config file example and most recent firmware and port your config over, then try again.

  <strong>Note About MKS and AZSMZ Boards</strong>
  <br><br>
  If you are using a MKS or an AZSMZ board, <strong>please</strong> note that those boards are toxic to the community and project.
  <br><br>
  As such, <strong>we respectfully request</strong> that you first contact the seller for help before asking in the forum or anywhere else in the community.
  <br><br>
  Community members generally do not want to help companies that hurt the project we are all building. Please read <a href="troubleshooting#somebody-refused-to-help-me-because-my-board-is-a-mks-what-s-that-all-about">this explanation</a> before posting.

## Using Pastebin

Instead of pasting your full configuration file or large portions of it, you can go to the [Pastebin.com](http://www.pastebin.com) website.

There you can post your config options, submit, and get a sharable link.

You can then give us your link instead of the configuration options. This is cleaner and easier for the persons trying to help you.

Alternatively, you can use the proper tags to "pack" your config file in a way where it is not completely displayed and users have to "expand" it, see forum formatting documentation.

## Reporting Bugs

If you have discovered a bug (and only if you have discovered a bug), you can report it as an "issue" on GitHub so the developers know about it and volunteers can try to work on solving it.

Before posting an issue please read [these guidelines](https://github.com/smoothieware/smoothieware/blob/edge/issue_template.md).
