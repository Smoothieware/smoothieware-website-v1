Smoothie is now on GitHub, here: [https://github.com/arthurwolf/Smoothie](https://github.com/arthurwolf/Smoothie)

It is still alpha status, but it works well for simple tasks like milling or basic lasercutting.

An Extruder module is in the works and much more is planned.

Please try it out by following the documentation on the [Home Page](/index.md) and feel free to [contact me](mailto:wolf.arthur@gmail.com) if you run into any trouble.
