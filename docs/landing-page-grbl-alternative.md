## You've Pushed GRBL as Far as It Can Go

### You're Hitting These Documented Limits:

- ❌ **GRBL's 2KB RAM Limit** - Motion planning buffer fills up; users report "out of program storage space" errors with complex toolpaths
- ❌ **30 KHz Stepping Rate Limit** - ATmega328 @ 16MHz limits step pulse generation; high-speed operations can struggle
- ❌ **3-Axis Design** - GRBL was designed for XYZ; adding 4th/5th/6th axes requires custom builds and pin remapping
- ❌ **Firmware Recompilation** - Many configuration changes require editing code, recompiling (5-10 min), and reflashing
- ❌ **Limited GPIO** - Arduino Uno/Nano pins are mostly allocated; adding features requires hardware changes
- ❌ **No Network Control** - USB only; cable disconnections can interrupt jobs

**Sound Familiar?**

You've probably tried:
- Splitting G-code files manually
- Lowering CAM software resolution to fit in memory
- Hacking multi-axis support into GRBL
- Living with sub-optimal results

**There's a Better Way.**

## What This Means in Practice

{::nomarkdown}
<sl-alert variant="success" open>
  <sl-icon slot="icon" name="lightning-charge"></sl-icon>
  <strong>Real-World Advantages</strong>
</sl-alert>
{:/nomarkdown}

**Complex 3D Surfacing:**
- GRBL: Chokes on large toolpaths from Fusion 360, have to split files
- Smoothie: Loads massive CAM files, handles them smoothly

**Rotary/Multi-Axis Work:**
- GRBL: Requires custom firmware builds, hacky pin remapping
- Smoothie: Native 4th, 5th, 6th axis support - just edit config

**Configuration Changes:**
- GRBL: Edit code → recompile (5-10 min) → upload → test → repeat if wrong
- Smoothie: Edit config.txt → save → reboot (30 seconds)

**Network Control:**
- GRBL: USB cable only, disconnects can kill jobs
- Smoothie: Ethernet option, no cable issues

**Adding Features:**
- GRBL: Arduino out of pins, limited options
- Smoothie: 63 GPIO available, add whatever you need

## Easy Transition for GRBL Users

{::nomarkdown}
<sl-alert variant="primary" open>
  <sl-icon slot="icon" name="arrow-left-right"></sl-icon>
  <strong>You Already Know Most of This</strong>
</sl-alert>
{:/nomarkdown}

### Similarities (What Stays the Same):

- ✅ **Same G-Code** - Standard RS274/NGC G-code, your CAM output works
- ✅ **GRBL Compatibility Mode** - Can parse GRBL-style G-code; special CNC builds available with grbl_mode enabled
- ✅ **Familiar Commands** - G0, G1, G2, G3, M3, M5, M8, M9 all work the same
- ✅ **Compatible Software** - bCNC, CNCjs, Universal G-Code Sender, Candle all work
- ✅ **Same Workflow** - CAM → controller → machine, nothing changes
- ✅ **Console Access** - Telnet or USB for real-time control and debugging (like GRBL's $$ interface but more powerful)

### Differences (Improvements):

**Configuration:**
- GRBL: `$$` commands + firmware recompilation
- Smoothie: Human-readable `config.txt` file

**Example - Changing Steps/mm:**

**GRBL Way:**
```
$100=250.000  // X steps/mm
$101=250.000  // Y steps/mm
$102=250.000  // Z steps/mm
```
Then recompile firmware for any advanced changes.

**Smoothie Way:**
```
alpha_steps_per_mm    250    # X axis
beta_steps_per_mm     250    # Y axis
gamma_steps_per_mm    250    # Z axis
```
Edit, save, reboot. Done in 30 seconds.

## Multi-Axis Support: The Game Changer

### Need More Than 3 Axes?

{::nomarkdown}
<sl-alert variant="warning" open>
  <sl-icon slot="icon" name="tools"></sl-icon>
  <strong>GRBL's Dirty Secret:</strong> It was designed for 3-axis CNC. Adding 4th/5th/6th axes requires custom builds, pin remapping, and lots of pain.
</sl-alert>
{:/nomarkdown}

**Smoothie's Native 6-Axis Support:**
- **X, Y, Z** - Primary linear axes (like GRBL)
- **A** - Rotary around X (4th axis indexing/milling)
- **B** - Rotary around Y (5th axis)
- **C** - Rotary around Z (6th axis)

**Use Cases:**
- 4-axis rotary engraving (wrap text around cylinders)
- 5-axis milling (complex sculpted surfaces)
- Custom kinematics (6DOF robots, specialized machines)
- Dual Y or dual Z setups (trivial config)

**Adding 4th Axis in Smoothie:**
```
# Just add these lines to config.txt
delta_steps_per_mm     50      # A axis (rotary)
delta_max_rate         30000   # A axis speed
```
Done. Seriously.

  <strong>What CNC Operators Say After Switching</strong>
</sl-alert>
{:/nomarkdown}

> "Was running GRBL on my DIY CNC router. Hit the wall with a 3D surfacing toolpath from Fusion 360 - file was too big. Tried Smoothie, problem solved. Never looked back."
>
> — r/hobbycnc member

> "GRBL served me well for basic 2.5D work, but I needed 4-axis for rotary engraving. Smoothie's native A-axis support is night and day better than hacking GRBL."
>
> — MakerForums user

> "The killer feature for me: text-file configuration. I was DONE recompiling GRBL firmware every time I wanted to tweak acceleration or stepper current."
>
> — Small shop CNC operator

> "Fusion 360 outputs complex adaptive clearing toolpaths that are huge. GRBL maxed out memory, Smoothie handles them like nothing."

## Software Compatibility

### Use Your Existing CNC Workflow

**G-Code Senders (All Work):**
- ✅ **bCNC** - Excellent support, popular choice for Smoothie
- ✅ **CNCjs** - Web-based control, works great
- ✅ **Universal G-Code Sender (UGS)** - Full compatibility
- ✅ **gSender** (Sienci Labs)
- ✅ **Any Standard G-Code Sender** - Smoothie speaks G-code

**CAM Software Integration:**
- ✅ **Fusion 360** - Post-processor available, or use generic G-code
- ✅ **Vectric (VCarve, Aspire)** - Standard G-code output works perfectly
- ✅ **Estlcam**
- ✅ **FreeCAD Path**
- ✅ **FlatCAM** (PCB milling)
- ✅ **Any CAM Software** - If it outputs G-code, it works

**You Don't Need to Change Your Workflow.**

Same CAM software → Same G-code sender → Better controller.

### Configuration Translation

Common GRBL $$ settings and their Smoothie equivalents:

| GRBL Setting | Smoothie Config |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `$100` (X steps/mm) | `alpha_steps_per_mm` |
| `$101` (Y steps/mm) | `beta_steps_per_mm` |
| `$102` (Z steps/mm) | `gamma_steps_per_mm` |
| `$110` (X max rate) | `alpha_max_rate` |
| `$120` (X accel) | `alpha_acceleration` |
| `$3` (direction invert) | `alpha_dir_pin` (add `!` to invert) |
| `$5` (limit pins invert) | `alpha_limit_pin` (add `^` for pullup) |

**Full Translation Guide:** Available in [Smoothie documentation](/configuration-options)

### Installation Time:
- **Wiring:** 2-4 hours (similar to GRBL Arduino wiring)
- **Configuration:** 30-60 minutes (guided by examples)
- **Learning Curve:** Minimal - if you know GRBL, you know 90% of Smoothie

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is Smoothie compatible with GRBL G-code?**

A: Yes. Smoothie uses standard RS274/NGC G-code. If your CAM software outputs GRBL G-code, it'll work on Smoothie.

**Q: Will my GRBL sender (bCNC, UGS) work?**

A: Yes. Most GRBL senders work fine with Smoothie. Some GRBL-specific features ($$ settings) won't work, but core G-code sending and control is compatible.

**Q: Do I need to relearn everything?**

A: No. If you know GRBL, you know 90% of Smoothie. Main difference is text-file configuration instead of $$ commands and firmware compilation.

**Q: What about $$ settings from GRBL?**

A: Smoothie uses `config.txt` instead. We provide a [translation guide](/configuration-options) showing GRBL $$ equivalents in Smoothie.

**Q: Why not just use GRBL-32 or grblHAL?**

A: GRBL-32 and grblHAL exist but are less mature and have smaller communities. Smoothie has 15 years of development, extensive documentation, and a large active community.

**Q: Can I use Fusion 360 / VCarve with Smoothie?**

A: Absolutely. Fusion 360 has Smoothie post-processors, or use generic G-code output. VCarve and other CAM software work perfectly with standard G-code output.

**Q: Is it harder to set up than GRBL?**

A: Wiring is similar (stepper motors, endstops, spindle). Configuration is arguably **easier** - text file editing vs recompiling firmware. Documentation is more extensive.
