# List of Smoothie Firmware Errors

When Smoothie encounters a problem, it will report an error number to help you diagnose and fix the issue.

This page lists all possible error codes, their causes, solutions, and any associated parameters.

## Error Reference

| Error Number | Cause | Solution | Parameters |
| ------------ | ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Invalid configuration line | Check there is no typo or other syntax error for that line | The line for which there is an error |
| 2 | Configuration line has no value | Check why Smoothie can not find a value for that line | The line for which there is no value found |
| 3 | A line was too long | The line was truncated, check why it is so long | The line that was found to be too long |
