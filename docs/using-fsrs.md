# Using FSRs with Smoothieboard

FSRs (Force Sensing Resistors) can be used as bed leveling sensors with Smoothieboard to provide automatic bed leveling for 3D printers.

## Overview

To use FSRs with the Smoothieboard, an auxiliary board is needed to interface the FSRs to the Smoothieboard's endstop input.

Smoothieware will accept this input as if it were a simple mechanical switch.

## Available FSR Controller Boards

### JohnSL FSR Endstop Board

JohnSL on [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnSL/FSR_Endstop) has created an FSR controller board specifically for this purpose.

**Where to buy:**
- [AndOrNot](http://www.andornot.co.uk/product/fsr-controller)
- [TriD Printing](http://www.tridprinting.com/Electronics/#3D-Printer-FSR)
- [UltiBots](http://www.ultibots.com/fsr-leveling)

**Resources:**
- [John's blog post](http://trains.socha.com/2014/05/auto-adjust-fsr-end-stop-detector.html) about the board

## Community Discussion and Resources

The [Deltabot group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/deltabot/fsr) is where most discussion on using FSRs is located.

**Topics to look for:**
- Alternative boards like the Arduino Mini
- WingWong's Trinket-derived design
- FSR mounting techniques and best practices
