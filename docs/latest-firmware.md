**Comments:**
- The original DokuWiki content contained a Vue.js script to dynamically generate a list of the latest commits from GitHub. Since Markdown does not support Vue.js or any dynamic scripting, I have provided a static representation of what the dynamic list might look like, with placeholders for the commit SHA, message, author, and date.
- The image used in the callout has been converted to Markdown image syntax and assumes the image is stored in a directory named `/images/start/`.
- The callout itself has been converted to a Markdown note for clarity and emphasis on the content.
- Any interactive or dynamic content that relies on JavaScript would need to be handled outside of the Markdown file, possibly through external scripts or server-side processing.
