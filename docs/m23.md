## M23: Select File

Issuing an **M23** selects a file that will be used to subsequently print using the M24 command.
The file will remain "selected" and all subsequent M24 commands will print that file until a different file selection (M23) is made.
If the file does not exist on the SD card an error will be returned (ERROR?).
The M23 command can be used to restart a file from the beginning, use M23 to reset it, then M24 to print.

> [!INFO]
> **Print:** Refers to running a job on any Smoothie attached device such as 3D printer, Laser engraver/cutter, CNC router etc.

### Format

The command is used as such:

```
M23 filename.gco
```

Which means: Select the file to be used in the subsequent M24 print/resume command.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Usage | Example |
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| `filename` | The file, on the SD card, will be printed in the subsequent M24 command | M20 myGcodeFile.gco |

The `filename` identifies the file to be used by subsequent M24 commands.

Smoothie supports long filenames and [8.3 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename).

If your SD card contents were:
- **config.txt**
- **firmware.cur**
- **Readme.txt**
- **myGcode.gco**

This means if you command:

```
M23 myGcode.gco
```

The file myGcode.gco would be queued for subsequent printing with the M24 command.

### Configuration

The M23 command requires no special configuration settings.
