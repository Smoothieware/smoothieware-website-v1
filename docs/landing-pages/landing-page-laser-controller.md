## Is Your Laser Controller Holding You Back?

### Common Frustrations with Stock Controllers:

- ❌ **K40 M2 Nano Reliability** - Documented 3-6 month failure rates; LightBurn lists it as "no support"
- ❌ **Limited Software Compatibility** - Many stock controllers only work with proprietary software
- ❌ **Slow Raster Engraving** - Stock controllers can be significantly slower than optimized alternatives
- ❌ **Limited Features** - Many controllers lack rotary axis support, network control, or advanced features
- ❌ **No LightBurn Support** - Stock K40 controllers not compatible with LightBurn
- ❌ **USB Connectivity Issues** - Long jobs can fail due to USB disconnections or PC power management

**For Professional Work, You Need Better Control.**
