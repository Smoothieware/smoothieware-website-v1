# G0 G-code

G0 means "move without activating the tool".

On CNC mills, it is used to go to a new area without cutting, it is also called a "rapid" move. 

On laser cutters, it is used the same way, and the laser is automatically turned off during the move.

On 3D printers, it is also called a "travel" move.

While traditionally on CNC mills G0 is supposed to be an "un-coordinated" move, on Smoothie it is coordinated anyway.

G0's evil twin is [G1](g1), which means "move while using the tool".

## Format

The command is used as such:

```
G0 X10 Y20 F30
```

Which means: move (without cutting) to X position 10, Y position 20, at a speed of 30 millimeters/minute.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Usage | Example |
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| `X` | Move to this position in the X axis | G0 X10 |
| `Y` | Move to this position in the Y axis | G0 Y10 |
| `Z` | Move to this position in the Z axis | G0 Z10 |
| `A` | Move to this position in the A axis | G0 A10 |
| `B` | Move to this position in the B axis | G0 B10 |
| `C` | Move to this position in the C axis | G0 C10 |
| `F` | Move at this speed in millimeters/minute | G0 Z10 F100 |

## Feedrate

The `F` parameter is modal. The speed is remembered and each subsequent command uses it.

This means if you do:

```
G0 X10 F100
G0 X20
G0 X30 F200
G0 X40
```

The first two moves will happen at 100 mm/minute, and the last two moves will happen at 200mm/minute.

  <sl-icon slot="icon" name="lightbulb"></sl-icon>
  <strong>Independent feedrates</strong><br><br>
  Note that both G0 and G1 have their own modal feedrates, and setting one doesn't influence the other.<br><br>
  This means if you do:<br><br>
  <code>G0 X10 F100<br>
  G1 X20 F200<br>
  G0 X30</code><br><br>
  The third move will actually move at 100 mm/minute as that is the latest feedrate set for G0 moves.
</sl-alert>

## Default feedrate

If you have just started your Smoothieboard and have never sent an `F` parameter, your G0 moves will move at the default "seek" feedrate.

This is set in the [configuration file](configuring-smoothie) by setting the `default_seek_rate` config option.

## Modal use

The G0 command is modal, if a line doesn't contain any gcode, it is assumed to be a `G0` or a `G1` command depending on the latest used.

This means if you do:

```
G0 X10
 X20
 Y10
```

It is the same as doing:

```
G0 X10
G0 X20
G0 Y10
```

Note the space character before each modal line, without that space, Smoothie will not know this is a modal command.

## Absolute and relative motion

There are two ways to specify positions: absolutely or relatively.

Smoothie is in absolute mode by default.

You enter absolute mode by sending the [G90](g90) Gcode, and you enter the relative mode by sending the [G91](g91) Gcode.

In absolute mode, all positions passed to G0 are relative to the 0 position for the current work coordinate.

In relative mode, all positions passed to G0 are relative to the current position.

This means if you do:

```
G90
G0 X10
G0 X20
```

Smoothie will move to the X position 10, then move to the X position 20, relative to the origin.

But if you do:

```
G91
G0 X10
G0 X20
```

Smoothie will move 10 millimeters relative to the current position, then move 20 millimeters further away from that new position (moving 30 millimeters total).
