You are responsible for your own safety.

Eyes cannot be replaced.

Work on lasers should be done by informed and well trained professionals, in safe environments. There are no second chances here, if you are not trained, get help from a professional.

Eye protection of insufficient quality is sold very commonly, test your eye protection by firing the laser at it to make sure it's actually capable of what it claims. 

Eye protection alone isn't enough, laser safety is an ensemble of procedures, knowledge and attention that must be paid. Improvisation has no place here.

Always make sure fire extinguishers of the adequate type are present on site.

A bucket of sand and a mini-shovel (which does not replace a fire extinguisher) can be a good tool to extinguish small "paper" fires in the machine without having to waste a fire extinguisher or wet the machine's internals.

### Door Safety Switch

If the machine does not come with a switch on the door that turns the laser off when the door is open, this is stupid and dangerous.

Please install that switch, and make sure it operates properly on a regular basis.

### Fire Hazard

If you leave your machine alone even for a few minutes, fire can start.
