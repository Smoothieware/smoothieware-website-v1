>
> - If you do not get an answer in the forum, maybe try the [support mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/smoothieware-support.md) and [IRC channel](http://smoothieware.org/irc.md). Please, if you post a question here, then go to IRC where it is answered immediately, come back here to delete the post so that somebody doesn't answer it here for nothing.
> - Please put: `[[details="config.txt"]]Your config file's content[[/details]]` around your copy/pasted configuration files, or any other large file, it makes them much easier to read. Please post your configuration file if you think it has any chance of being relevant.
