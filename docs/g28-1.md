# G28.1 G-code

G28.1 means "store the origin position that the machine goes to when the `G28` command is issued".

This position is stored into memory, but is lost if the machine is reset. You can make that position permanent by sending the [M500](m500) G-code.

## Format

The command is used as such:

```
G28.1 X10 Y10
```

Which means: record the origin position as being at the X position 10 and Y position 10

## Parameters

| Parameter | Usage                           | Example    |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `X`       | Record origin position for X axis | G28.1 X10 |
| `Y`       | Record origin position for Y axis | G28.1 Y10 |
| `Z`       | Record origin position for Z axis | G28.1 Z10 |

## Friend G-codes

This G-code sets the origin position that the [G28](g28) G-code goes to.

And you can use the [M500](m500) G-code to save this position into the [config-override](configuring-smoothie) permanently.
