# Panel Guide

A panel is the combination of a screen and some kind of input method (buttons, encoder, touchscreen) attached to the machine.

This allows you to control your machine without a computer connection.

## What Can You Do With a Panel?

With a panel connected to your Smoothieboard, you can:

- **Move the machine**: Jog axes to position your tool or workpiece
- **Start print jobs**: Browse and execute files from the SD card
- **Monitor status**: View temperatures, positions, and progress
- **Adjust settings**: Change feed rates, temperatures, and other parameters
- **Emergency stop**: Quickly halt the machine if needed
- **Control accessories**: Turn fans, lights, and other devices on/off

## Supported Panel Types

Smoothieboard supports several types of panels:

### RepRapDiscount GLCD

1. **Choose your panel**: Select from the supported panel types above
2. **Wire the panel**: Connect it to your Smoothieboard (see wiring guide for your specific panel)
3. **Configure Smoothie**: Modify your config file to enable panel support
