In an instant. In the blink of an eye, quite literally.

  <strong>CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS:</strong><br><br>
  <strong>Never</strong> look into the beam or at any surface the beam might reflect off of.<br><br>
  <strong>Never</strong> have the machine powered while the door is open.

You are responsible for your own safety.

Eyes cannot be replaced.

Work on lasers should be done by informed and well trained professionals, in safe environments. There are no second chances here, if you are not trained, get help from a professional.

Eye protection of insufficient quality is sold very commonly, test your eye protection by firing the laser at it to make sure it's actually capable of what it claims.

Eye protection alone isn't enough, laser safety is an ensemble of procedures, knowledge and attention that must be paid. Improvisation has no place here.

Always make sure fire extinguishers of the adequate type are present on site.

A bucket of sand and a mini-shovel (which does not replace a fire extinguisher) can be a good tool to extinguish small "paper" fires in the machine without having to waste a fire extinguisher or wet the machine's internals.


### Door Safety Switch

If the machine does not come with a switch on the door that turns the laser off when the door is open, this is stupid and dangerous.

Please install that switch, and make sure it operates properly on a regular basis.

### Safety Interlock Requirements

Professional laser installations use multiple safety interlocks:

- **Door switch**: Cuts power to laser when enclosure is opened
- **Redundant switches**: Best practice is to use two independent door switches for fail-safe operation
- **Emergency stop button**: Immediately accessible and tested regularly
- **Key switch**: Prevents unauthorized operation
- **Beam enclosure**: Prevents accidental exposure to beam path

All interlocks should be tested regularly and never bypassed or disabled.

### Fire Hazard

If you leave your machine alone even for a few minutes, fire can start.

  They can burn your house, and they can burn your eyes. Be careful and never leave your laser unattended.
