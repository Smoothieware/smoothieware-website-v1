# Smoothie v1

As Smoothie used more and more of the v1 hardware with new features, we started getting stuck and created [Smoothieboard v2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arthurwolf/smoothieboard-v2).

Lots of things change with v2, so v1 and v2 can't easily share documentation.

This page is here to provide you with a snapshot of the v1 documentation, before it was ultimately converted into the v2 documentation.

## Accessing v1 Documentation

You can either:

- Download a clone of the website for local browsing (there's also one of those on your Smoothieboard's SD card): [Link](http://v1.smoothieware.org)
- Or go to the clone hosted at [v1.smoothieware.org](http://v1.smoothieware.org)
