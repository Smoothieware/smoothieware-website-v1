## M3 G-code

M3 starts the spindle at a specific speed.

### What is a Spindle?

A spindle is a controlled motor that turns a tool (such as an endmill) at a given speed to allow it to remove material from the workpiece.

This is commonly used in CNC milling operations.

### Speed Parameter

The M3 command must be accompanied by an `S` parameter which sets the speed of rotation.

### Related Commands

M3's counterpart is the [M5](m5) command which turns the spindle off (equivalent to `M3 S0`).

## Format

The command is used as such:

```gcode
M3 S1000
```

Which means: start the spindle and make it turn at 1000 rotations per minute.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Usage | Example |
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| `S`       | The spindle must turn at this speed in rotations per minute | M3 S1000 |

## Configuration

The spindle functionality of Smoothie is configured via the [Spindle module](spindle-module).

You'll need to set up appropriate configuration options in your config file to enable spindle control.

### Required Setup

Before using M3, ensure you have:

- Enabled the spindle module in your configuration
- Configured the appropriate pin for spindle control
- Set the spindle speed range (min/max RPM)
