# <mcode>M24</mcode>: Start/Resume SD Print

Issuing an <mcode>M24</mcode> starts printing the file selected with the <mcode>M23</mcode> command.
{:/nomarkdown}

### Resuming Paused Prints

{::nomarkdown}
If the print was previously paused with <mcode>M25</mcode>, printing is resumed from that point.
{:/nomarkdown}

When resuming a paused print, Smoothieware automatically runs the macro file `resume.g` (if it exists) prior to resuming.

### Restarting from Beginning

{::nomarkdown}
To restart a file from the beginning, use <mcode>M23</mcode> to reset it, then <mcode>M24</mcode> to start printing.
{:/nomarkdown}

{::nomarkdown}
<sl-alert variant="neutral" open>
  <sl-icon slot="icon" name="info-circle"></sl-icon>
  <strong>Print:</strong> In this context, "print" refers to running a job on any Smoothie-controlled device such as 3D printer, laser engraver/cutter, CNC router, etc.
</sl-alert>
{:/nomarkdown}

## Format

The command is used as such:

```
M24
```

{::nomarkdown}
Which means: Print the file that was previously selected by the <mcode>M23</mcode> command.
{:/nomarkdown}

## Parameters

{::nomarkdown}
The <mcode>M24</mcode> command requires no parameters.

It operates on the file previously selected with <mcode>M23</mcode>.
{:/nomarkdown}

## Example

If your SD card's contents were:

- config.txt
- firmware.cur
- Readme.txt
- myGcode.gco

And you previously executed:

```
M23 myGcode.gco
```

Then issuing the command:

```
M24
```

Will result in the G-code commands in the file *myGcode.gco* being executed.

## Configuration

{::nomarkdown}
The <mcode>M24</mcode> command requires no special configuration settings.
{:/nomarkdown}

However, you can create a `resume.g` file on the SD card to run custom G-code when resuming from a pause.
