## M23: Select File

Issuing an **M23** selects a file from the SD card that will be used for printing with the M24 command.

The file will remain "selected" and all subsequent M24 commands will print that file until a different file is selected.

### Error Handling

If the file does not exist on the SD card, an error will be returned (ERROR?).

### Restarting Files

The M23 command can be used to restart a file from the beginning.

Use M23 to select/reset the file, then M24 to start printing from the beginning.

{::nomarkdown}
<sl-alert variant="neutral" open>
  <sl-icon slot="icon" name="info-circle"></sl-icon>
  <strong>Print:</strong> In this context, "print" refers to running a job on any Smoothie-controlled device such as 3D printer, laser engraver/cutter, CNC router, etc.
</sl-alert>
{:/nomarkdown}

## Format

The command is used as such:

```
M23 filename.gco
```

Which means: Select the file to be used in the subsequent M24 print/resume command.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Usage | Example |
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| `filename` | The file, on the SD card, will be printed in the subsequent M24 command | M20 myGcodeFile.gco |

### Filename Support

The `filename` parameter identifies the file to be used by subsequent M24 commands.

Smoothie supports both long filenames and [8.3 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename).

## Example

If your SD card contents were:

- **config.txt**
- **firmware.cur**
- **Readme.txt**
- **myGcode.gco**

This means if you command:

```
M23 myGcode.gco
```

The file myGcode.gco would be queued for subsequent printing with the M24 command.

To actually start printing, you would then issue:

```
M24
```

## Configuration

The M23 command requires no special configuration settings.

The SD card must be properly inserted and contain the file you're trying to select.
