# {::nomarkdown}<mcode>M21</mcode>{:/nomarkdown}: Initialize SD card

{::nomarkdown}

<sl-alert variant="neutral" open>

  <strong>Compatibility Command:</strong> This command performs NO operation in Smoothieware and is kept for compatibility only.
</sl-alert>
{:/nomarkdown}

This command exists in Smoothieware purely for compatibility with other firmware (like Marlin/RepRap firmware).

When received, Smoothieware acknowledges the command but does nothing.

Smoothieware automatically initializes the SD card on boot, so manual initialization is not required.

**V1 Behavior:**

{::nomarkdown}<mcode>M21</mcode>{:/nomarkdown} is recognized but performs no operation. Your Smoothieboard automatically initializes the SD card at boot, making this command unnecessary for normal operation. It's provided only to allow G-code files written for other firmware (Marlin, RepRap) to work without modification.

{::nomarkdown}
</v1>
<v2>
{:/nomarkdown}

**V2 Behavior:**

{::nomarkdown}<mcode>M21</mcode>{:/nomarkdown} is recognized but performs no operation. V2 uses modern SDIO drivers for improved SD card performance and reliability, but like V1, automatic initialization occurs at boot. This command is maintained for backward compatibility with G-code files and control software written for other firmware platforms.

## Format

The command is used as such:

```plaintext
M21
```

Which means: the command will be received but Smoothieware will perform no operation.

## Parameters

The M21 command requires no parameters.

### Example

If you command:

```plaintext
M21
```

Smoothieware will acknowledge the command but perform no operation.

The SD card will remain in its current state.

## Configuration

The {::nomarkdown}<mcode>M21</mcode>{:/nomarkdown} command requires no special configuration settings.

Since Smoothieware handles SD card initialization automatically, this command is not necessary for normal operation.
