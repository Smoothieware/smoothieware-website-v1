# {::nomarkdown}<mcode>M21</mcode>{:/nomarkdown}: Initialize SD card

{::nomarkdown}
<sl-alert variant="neutral" open>
  <sl-icon slot="icon" name="info-circle"></sl-icon>
  <strong>Compatibility Command:</strong> This command performs NO operation in Smoothieware and is kept for compatibility only.
</sl-alert>
{:/nomarkdown}

This command exists in Smoothieware purely for compatibility with other firmware (like Marlin/RepRap firmware).

When received, Smoothieware acknowledges the command but does nothing.

Smoothieware automatically initializes the SD card on boot, so manual initialization is not required.

## Format

The command is used as such:

```plaintext
M21
```

Which means: the command will be received but Smoothieware will perform no operation.

## Parameters

The M21 command requires no parameters.

### Example

If you command:

```plaintext
M21
```

Smoothieware will acknowledge the command but perform no operation.

The SD card will remain in its current state.

## Configuration

The {::nomarkdown}<mcode>M21</mcode>{:/nomarkdown} command requires no special configuration settings.

Since Smoothieware handles SD card initialization automatically, this command is not necessary for normal operation.
