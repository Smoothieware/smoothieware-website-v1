# <gcode>G18</gcode> G-code

<gcode>G18</gcode> means "all commands are now to be interpreted in the XZ plane".

This command essentially changes the meaning (or plane) of the `I`, `J`, and `K` parameters of the <gcode>G2</gcode> and <gcode>G3</gcode> G-codes.

Smoothie starts in the <gcode>G17</gcode> mode (the default plane is the XY plane).

You can change this with the <gcode>G18</gcode> or <gcode>G19</gcode> commands, and you can come back to the "normal" plane with the <gcode>G17</gcode> command.

This command is modal, meaning that once it is executed, all Gcodes after it are now in this now "mode", until changed by another mode-changing Gcode of its family.
