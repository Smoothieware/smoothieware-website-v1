G91 means "all moves starting now are in relative coordinates".

This means positions are given relative to the current position, and not relative to the 0,0,0 point of the current workspace coordinate system (which is what [G90](g90) does).

When Smoothie starts, [G90](g90) is the default mode, not G91.

G91 is often used when G-code is manually sent to the machine.

`G91`'s evil twin is `G90`.

## Format

The command is used as such:

```
G91
```

Which means: starting now all positions are relative.

## Parameters

No parameters.
