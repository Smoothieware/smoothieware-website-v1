{::nomarkdown}
<gcode>G17</gcode> means "all commands are now to be interpreted in the XY plane".

This command essentially changes the meaning (or plane) of the `I`, `J`, and `K` parameters of the <gcode>G2</gcode> and <gcode>G3</gcode> G-codes.

Smoothie starts in the <gcode>G17</gcode> mode (the default plane is the XY plane).

However, if you changed the plane with the <gcode>G18</gcode> or <gcode>G19</gcode> commands, you can come back to the "normal" plane with this command.

This command is modal, meaning that once it is executed, all Gcodes after it are now in this now "mode", until changed by another mode-changing Gcode of its family.
