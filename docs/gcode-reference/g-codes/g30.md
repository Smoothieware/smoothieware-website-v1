<gcode>G30</gcode> means "move the probe until it hits something in the Z axis".
{:/nomarkdown}

## On CNC Mills

{::nomarkdown}
On CNC mills it can be used to:

- Find where the workpiece is located in the Z dimension
- Find the length of a newly inserted tool
- Find the touch point between a tool and the workpiece
{:/nomarkdown}

## On 3D Printers

{::nomarkdown}
On a 3D printer it can be used to:

- Find the touch point of the bed and actuator
- Calibrate [Delta](delta) machines
- Automatically level beds with unequal heights

To probe in other axes like X and Y, see the <gcode>G38.2</gcode> and <gcode>G38.3</gcode> G-codes.
{:/nomarkdown}

## Format

The command is used as such:

```
G30
```

Which means: move (in the Z axis) until the probe is triggered, then report what distance was traveled.

You can also do:

```
G30 Z10
```

{::nomarkdown}
Which means: move (in the Z axis) until the probe is triggered, then set the current Z position to 10 (using <gcode>G92</gcode> Z10).
{:/nomarkdown}

This is useful for example if you want to use the probe to measure the distance between something else on the actuator and what is touched, and you know the distance between the probe's height and that thing's height.

It is also possible to specify a speed at which to move with:

```
G30 F100
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Usage                                      | Example       |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `Z`       | Once the probe hits, set the Z position to this value | <gcode>G30</gcode> Z0      |
| `F`       | Move at this speed in millimeters/minute  | <gcode>G30</gcode> Z10 F100|

## Feedrate

The `F` parameter sets the movement speed for this move.

It sets the speed only for this specific move and is not modal.

It temporarily overrides the <setting v1="zprobe.slow_feedrate" v2="zprobe.slow_feedrate"></setting> [configuration option](configuring-smoothie), see [zprobe](zprobe).

## Configuration

This command is configured via the [Zprobe](zprobe) module's options.
