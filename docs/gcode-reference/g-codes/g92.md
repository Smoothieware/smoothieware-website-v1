## Description

The `G92` G-code means "set an offset for all coordinate systems".

To see more information on the `G92` Gcode see [G92-cnc](g92-cnc).

## 3D Printer Usage

On 3D printers, `G92 E0` will reset the currently selected extruder position to 0.

This is commonly used at the beginning of print jobs to ensure the extruder position starts from a known state.
