## Overview

The `G28` G-code can mean different things depending on whether you are using a CNC mill, or a 3D printer.

This is because when the Reprap project chose its G-codes, and what they are supposed to do, they completely ignored the existing G-code standard, and messed everything up.

Not our fault!

On a Reprap, the `G28` G-code means "go to the endstops and stop moving when you have hit them".

On a CNC mill (traditionally), the `G28` G-code means "go to the recorded origin point for the machine".

In the Smoothie firmware, if you set <setting v1="grbl_mode" v2="general.grbl_mode"></setting> to `true` (and/or have the CNC build), it will have the "CNC mill" meaning, and if you set it to `false` (or do not set it at all), it will have the Reprap meaning.

See [grbl-mode](grbl-mode) for more information.
