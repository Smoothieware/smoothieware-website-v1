## M20: List SD card

**M20** lists the contents of the SD card connected to your Smoothieboard.

When you issue an **M20** command, Smoothie reads the SD card contents and outputs the file list to the serial port.

A properly connected host will receive and display the Smoothie's SD card directory to its console.

### Troubleshooting

To verify and debug your Smoothie's serial connection, try the troubleshooting guide in the [debug section](troubleshooting).

## Format

The command is used as such:

```gcode
M20 [S] [P]
```

**Which means:** output the contents of SD card to serial port while using `S` to define the format and `P` defines the directory to list.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Usage | Example |
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| `S` | Style: Defines the format used to present the output | `M20 S0` |
| `P` | Directory: Defines the directory that will be listed | `M20` |

### Smoothie Implementation

The `S` parameter when used with Smoothie supports Style 0 only, which is the default.

If you do not include `S`, it will assume `S0`.

The `P` parameter is not supported by Smoothie.

Smoothie always lists the SD card's root directory.

## Example

If your SD card contents were:

- config.txt
- firmware.cur
- Readme.txt
- myGcode.gcode

This means if you command:

```gcode
M20 S0
```

or

```gcode
M20 S0 P1
```

or

```gcode
M20 S1 P1
```

or

```gcode
M20 P2
```

...they will all print the following to the connected console:

```
Ok
config.txt
firmware.cur
Readme.txt
myGcode.gcode
```

## Configuration

The M20 command requires no special configuration settings.

It works as long as the SD card is properly inserted and recognized by Smoothieboard.
