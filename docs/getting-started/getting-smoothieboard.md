## Broken boards

If you feel like a hacker extraordinaire, or can live with a bit of loss of functionality, you can also get partially broken boards [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ebay.fr/itm/142933845406&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1537661637156000&usg=AFQjCNEqrNzH7Dl5bpKcPrc2p-jO6E5_xw) at a very serious discount.
