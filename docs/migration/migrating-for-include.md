If you are migrating from another firmware, here are guides to help you understand how some values from your old firmware match the values in your new Smoothie system.

Smoothie uses different configuration parameters and approaches than other common CNC/3D printer firmwares. These guides will help you translate your existing settings.

## Migration Guides

Choose the guide that matches your current firmware:

- [Moving from Marlin to Smoothie](from-marlin) - For users coming from Marlin (common in 3D printers)
- [Moving from GRBL to Smoothie](from-grbl) - For users coming from GRBL (common in CNC mills and laser cutters)

For detailed information about configuration format differences between V1 and V2, choosing the right version, and common migration pitfalls to avoid, see the [Migration Details](migration-details) page.
