## Description

G10 means "retract the filament from the hotend using the extruder."

You need to configure the length to retract in your [extruder module](extruder)'s [configuration](configuring-smoothie) by setting the `retract_length` parameter.

By default, most slicing programs will use [G1](g1) commands to retract, but this is the more modern way of doing it.

G10's evil twin is [G11](g11), which means "unretract the filament from the hotend using the extruder."

## Conflict with CNC Standard

  <strong>G10 Command Conflict</strong><br><br>

  <code>G10</code> means "retract" for 3D printers, but it also means other things for CNC mills.<br><br>

  This conflict is because the Reprap project chose its Gcode without any consideration for the Gcode standard that had existed for decades, and this despite the fact that the real G10 could have been useful for 3D printers.<br><br>

  Smoothie supports both formats: if you use G10 without parameters it will do the 3D printer thing, and if you use it with parameters it will do the CNC mill thing.
