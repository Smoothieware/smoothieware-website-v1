# Smoothieware Mini

Smoothieware Mini is a [free, opensource](http://dank.bengler.no/-/page/show/5470_grbl) firmware for an accessory system designed to run on ARM Cortex-M0 and run as extensions of a [Smoothieboard](smoothieboard.md), though they could just as easily be driven from another platform such as RAMPS or a Raspberry Pi. Eventually the system may also be ported to AVR.

## Boards in Development

- [SmoothiePanel](smoothiepanel.md) char display backpack
- [SmoothieDriver](smoothiedriver.md) series of motor controllers

## Status

The first prototype accessory boards have been made and the design of the core firmware system is well under way. Hopefully the first accessory boards will be available (complete with working firmware) in early 2013.

## User Documentation

Nothing yet until things are further along :)
