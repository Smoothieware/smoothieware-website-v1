    notes:
      - Cannot be used unless machine has Z homing endstops.
      - Saves the current Z position as the homing offset.
      - Must be followed by M500 to persist to SD card.
      - Preferred method over manual `gamma_max` configuration as it uses current position directly.

    description:
      - Save configuration to SD card.
      - Writes current configuration and calibration data to the SD card for persistence across reboots.
    parameters: []
    notes:
      - Essential for saving calibration values like Z height offsets (set via M306 or M665), probe offsets, and saved G92 positions.
      - Without M500, configuration changes are lost on power cycle.
      - Can save both Z height and delta calibration data together.

    parameters: []
    example:

    notes:
      - Used as pause/user-input mechanism; possibly related to or alternative to M1 support.
      - Mentioned in `/project/news/todo` Stops once movement queue is empty (not instant).
      - All state is saved.
      - Heaters turned off by default (configurable).
      - Jogging and extruding allowed during suspension.
      - Can be resumed with `resume` command or M601.
      - Requires upstream host support (Pronterface and OctoPrint support it).
      - Fully recoverable with position maintained.
      - Ideal for mid-print filament changes or filament-out detection.

      - Must be followed by M500 to persist to SD card.
      - Commonly used for Z height and delta calibration data.

      - "Three ways to clear Halt state: issue M999 from host, hold physical kill button for 2 seconds, or use LCD panel."
      - Position remains lost after emergency stop - must home all axes before attempting further movement.
      - Do not resume work without verifying machine state.
