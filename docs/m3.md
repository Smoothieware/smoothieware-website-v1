## M3 G-code

M3 means "start the spindle at a specific speed".

A spindle is a controlled motor that turns a tool (endmill) at a given speed to allow it to remove material from the workpiece.

The M3 command must be accompanied by an `S` parameter which sets the speed of rotation.

M3's evil twin is the [M5](m5.md) command which turns the spindle off (it is equivalent to `M3 S0`).

### Format

The command is used as such:

```
M3 S1000
```

Which means: start the spindle and make it turn at 1000 rotations per minute.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Usage | Example |
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| `S`       | The spindle must turn at this speed in rotations per minute | M3 S1000 |

### Configuration

The spindle functionality of Smoothie is configured via the [Spindle module](spindle-module.md)
