# Lasers will make you blind. In an instant. In the blink of an eye, quite literally.

> [!DANGER]
> **Never** look into the beam or at any surface the beam might reflect off of.
> **Never** have the machine powered while the door is open.

You are responsible for your own safety.

Eyes cannot be replaced.

If the machine does not come with a switch on the door that turns the laser off when the door is open, this is stupid and dangerous. Please install that switch.

If you leave your machine alone even for a few minutes, this can happen to you:

**Comments:**
- Converted the callout to a markdown alert/callout.
- The image source was kept as is, assuming the path will be corrected during the website migration.
- The HTML div tags were kept for the centered text, as markdown does not support text alignment.
