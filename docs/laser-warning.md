You are responsible for your own safety.

Eyes cannot be replaced.

## Door Safety Switch

If the machine does not come with a switch on the door that turns the laser off when the door is open, this is stupid and dangerous.

Please install that switch.

## Fire Hazard

If you leave your machine alone even for a few minutes, fire can start.
