## G21 G-code

`G21` means "all moves starting now have their units specified in millimeters (metric units)".

`G21`'s evil twin is [`G20`](g20), which means "all moves starting now have their units specified in inches (imperial units)".

An inch is 25.4 millimeters.

`G21` is the default when Smoothie starts.

### Format

The command is used as such:

```plaintext
G21
```

Which means: units are now metric until another G-code changes it (modal command).

### Parameters

No parameters.
