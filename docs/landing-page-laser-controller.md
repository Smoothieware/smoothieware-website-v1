## Is Your Laser Controller Holding You Back?

### Common Frustrations with Stock Controllers:

- ❌ **K40 M2 Nano Reliability** - Documented 3-6 month failure rates; LightBurn lists it as "no support"
- ❌ **Limited Software Compatibility** - Many stock controllers only work with proprietary software
- ❌ **Slow Raster Engraving** - Stock controllers can be significantly slower than optimized alternatives
- ❌ **Limited Features** - Many controllers lack rotary axis support, network control, or advanced features
- ❌ **No LightBurn Support** - Stock K40 controllers not compatible with LightBurn
- ❌ **USB Connectivity Issues** - Long jobs can fail due to USB disconnections or PC power management

**For Professional Work, You Need Better Control.**

A: Similar to any controller replacement. Wire stepper motors, limit switches, and laser PWM control. Most laser owners complete installation in 2-4 hours using our guides.

**Q: Will LightBurn work perfectly?**

A: Yes. Full feature support including rotary, camera, grayscale, and network control. This is the upgrade LightBurn users recommend.

**Q: Can I add a rotary axis later?**

A: Absolutely. Native 4th axis support is built-in. Just configure it when you're ready.

**Q: What about air assist / water cooling / exhaust fan control?**

A: Smoothieboard can control all of these via the Switch module (included in firmware, no extra cost).

**Q: Is $200 worth it for professional work?**

A: Ask yourself: What's the cost of a failed client job from controller issues? What's the value of using LightBurn properly? Most professional laser users say this upgrade pays for itself quickly.
