# M5 G-code

M5 means "stop the spindle's rotation".

A spindle is a controlled motor that turns a tool (endmill) at a given speed to allow it to remove material from the workpiece.

M5's evil twin is the [M3](m3.md) command which is used to start the spindle and specify its rotation speed.

## Format

The command is used as such:

```gcode
M5
```

Which means: stop the spindle's rotation.

## Parameters

No parameters.

## Configuration

The spindle functionality of Smoothie is configured via the [Spindle module](spindle-module.md).
