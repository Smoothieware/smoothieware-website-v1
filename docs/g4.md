G4 means "pause for a given duration of time".

## Format

The command is used as such:

```plaintext
G4 S5
```

Which means: pause for 5 seconds.

This is useful for example to wait for spindles to ramp up to speed, or to wait for small layers to cool down on 3D printers.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Usage                               | Example  |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|----------|
| `S`       | Duration to wait in seconds         | G4 S10   |
| `P`       | Duration to wait in milliseconds (thousandth of a second) | G4 P100 |

Note that if `grbl_mode` is set to `true` then the `P` parameter is the duration to wait in seconds, not milliseconds, as a float value. This is to conform to G-Code standards.
