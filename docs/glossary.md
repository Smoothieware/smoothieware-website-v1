## A

### AC
**Alternative current**

In AC, the current moves back and forth with the changing magnetic field.

This is the type of electricity from wall sockets in your home.

# Cases/Enclosures

# CNC

# Current
Current is a flow of electrons measured in Amperes (Amps), past in a single point in the circuit within a certain amount of time.

# DC
**Direct current**  
In DC, the current travels in only one direction, for example in batteries.

# Endstop
An endstop is a mechanical switch that is put at an end of a given axis so we can detect when we are getting close to an end of a given axis.  
There are 6 endstop inputs: Two for each of the three axes.  
« You are at the end…STOP!! »

# Flashing

# Used On/Off Switch

# Gcode

# GitHub

# GPIO

# Hall Effect Sensor

# Hall-O

# Homing
Homing is telling Smoothie to go "seek" an endstop for an axis (or all of them). Once it is hit, we know where we are, before we didn't.

# Hotend

# Limit Switch
Limit switches are just using those same endstops to prevent the user from going out of bounds.

# Module

# Mosfets
Smoothie has two types of mosfets: small ones that are capable of running fans or hotends, and big ones that are capable of running beds or hotends.

# NC, NO

# Nozzle

# VBB (Stepper Motor)

# Pinout

# Power

# Pronterface

# Pullup, Pulldown

# PSU
Stands for Power Supply Unit.  
Converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer.  
- Brick type PSU  
- ATX type PSU

# Resistance
Resistance is a restriction to the flow of electrons. Resistance is measured in Ohms.

# Sense, Sensor

# USB
**Universal Serial Bus**

# Voltage

# Zprobe
