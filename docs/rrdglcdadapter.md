# RRD GLCD Adapter board

This adapter allows you to connect a [Reprapdiscount GLCD panel](http://smoothieware.org/panel) to a Smoothieboard easily.

All of the panel's functionalities are available:

- Display
- Encoder selector
- Button
- Buzzer
- SD card

## Open Hardware

The Source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/llegoff/GlcdAdapter2)

## Getting one

You can now get a RRDGLCD Adapter [here](http://robotseed.com).
For US another version coming soon [here](http://shop.uberclock.com)

> [!NOTE]
> Both versions look a bit different, but are functionally identical and are used the same way. The RobotSeed version is pictured here, but the instructions are identical for the Uberclock version.

## Assembly

Place the 3-pin connectors below the PCB

![GLCD Adapter Kit](images/rrdglcdadapter/glcdav2-kit.jpg)

And solder

![GLCD Adapter Soldering](images/rrdglcdadapter/glcdav2-weld0.jpg)

Mount the EXP1 & EXP2 connectors, and solder

![RRDGLCD Version](images/rrdglcdadapter/rrdglcdvo.png)

On some RRDGLCD the connector are reversed

## Power supply

If Smoothieboard has a good 5V regulator, or a 5V power supply, the panel of the power supply can be drawn from this one by means of a diode (ex 1N5817).

![GLCD Adapter Power Supply](images/rrdglcdadapter/glcdav2-power1.jpg)

If not, please install a voltage regulator Recom 785.0-1

The diode and regulator may be mounted at the same time.

## Configuration

The adapter is configured for Smoothieboard v1.0a and newer.

For v1.0 Smoothieboard, configure the PCB

![GLCD Adapter Configuration](images/rrdglcdadapter/glcdav2-config1.jpg)

![GLCD Adapter Configuration 2](images/rrdglcdadapter/glcdav2-config2.jpg)

Cut the jumper track, and drop a welding goute on the other part of the jumper.

## Use

Solder the connector missing

Update firmware (version after October 2014), see [Flashing Smoothie firmware](flashing-smoothie-firmware)
Edit the config file on the ÂµSD:

panel.external_sd                     true              # set to true if there is an extrernal sdcard on the panel
panel.external_sd.spi_channel         1                 # set spi channel the sdcard is on
panel.external_sd.spi_cs_pin          0.28              # set spi chip select for the sdcard (or any spare pin)
panel.external_sd.sdcd_pin            0.27!^            # sd detect signal (set to nc if no sdcard detect) (or any spare pin)
```

If you do not want to use the buzzer, leaving out the `panel.buzz_pin` line will leave the pin floating. As there is no pull-down on the buzzer, it will keep buzzing. To avoid this, you can either solder a pull-down resistor on the adapter board or you can use this little hack:

```markdown
switch.nonoise.enable                        true
switch.nonoise.output_pin                    1.31v
switch.nonoise.output_type                   digital
```

This will create a pseudo-switch that does nothing, but it will enable the pull-down on the pin. You have to leave out the `panel.buzz_pin` line.

The V1 of this adapter was not capable of accessing the panel's SD card slot.

This functionality can be made available on the v1 by cutting track on PCB

![GLCD Adapter V1](images/rrdglcdadapter/gcldv1-03.jpg)

And soldering a cable under the PCB
