# PID Autotuning

Smoothie can automatically tune (find) your P, I, and D factors using a process described [here](http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2012/01/arduino-pid-autotune-library/).

Here is an example of the G-code command used to launch PID autotune:

```
M303 E0 S190
```

- `E0` is the number of the heater or bed temperature control module, determined by the order that they appear in the config file. Here it would be 0 for the hotend, and 1 for the bed.
- `S190` is the temperature to autotune for. Use the temperature you will be using your heater at in real life. For a hotend here we use 190Â°C.

When you run the command, tuning begins:

```
Target: 190.0
Start PID tune, command is M303 E0 S190
T: Starting PID Autotune, M304 aborts
ok
T:  21.3/190.0 @80 1 0/8
T:  22.0/190.0 @80 1 0/8
T:  22.3/190.0 @80 1 0/8
T:  22.1/190.0 @80 1 0/8
Etc...
```

It continues for 3 to 8 cycles, heating up, cooling down. Then:

```
Cycle 4: max: 246.189, min: 227.627, avg separation: 0.418274
	Ku: 34.9838, Pu: 39.85
	Trying:
	Kp:  21.0
	Ki: 1.053
	Kd:   105
PID Autotune Complete! The settings above have been loaded into memory, but not written to your config file.
```

Now edit your configuration to use those three values (`Kp` is `p_factor`, `Ki` is `i_factor`, `Kd` is `d_factor`), reset, and temperature control should work much better. (Also `M301` can be used to set the PID values and saved with `M500`)

Alternatively, you can also enter the following G-code:

```
M500
```

Which will save the configuration values automatically in a configuration override file.
