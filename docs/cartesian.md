# Cartesian Arm Solution

The Cartesian arm solution is the most common type of machine configuration used in 3D printers and CNC machines.

In a Cartesian machine, each actuator (motor and linear rail) directly corresponds to an axis in Cartesian space:

- **Alpha actuator** controls the **X axis**
- **Beta actuator** controls the **Y axis**
- **Gamma actuator** controls the **Z axis**

This is the simplest arm solution, as there is a direct 1:1 relationship between the motors and the movement in space - no mathematical conversion is needed.

## Configuration

To configure your machine to use the Cartesian arm solution, add this to your configuration file:

```
arm_solution cartesian
```

This is the default setting in Smoothieware, so if you don't specify an arm solution, Cartesian will be used automatically.

## Common Cartesian Machines

Cartesian configurations are used in:

- Most desktop 3D printers (like Prusa i3, Creality Ender, etc.)
- CNC routers and mills
- Laser cutters
- Pick and place machines

## Example: C-Beam Machine
