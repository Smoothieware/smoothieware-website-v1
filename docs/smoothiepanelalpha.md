# SmoothiePanel

SmoothiePanel is an [Open Source Hardware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware) integrated PanelMax using the [LPC 1114](http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/cortex_m0/lpc1100_x_l/LPC1114FBD48.html) ARM Cortex-M0 chip to bring a 20x4 RGB Character Display, UART, SPI, 4bit ADC, 16bit GPIO down to a single I2C port. The basic interface panel supports an illuminated pause button, an illuminated back button, an RGB Click Encoder, and lots of extra io!
It is intended to control a [Smoothieboard](http://smoothieware.org/Smoothieboard) ( [GPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpl) too ), though could easily be connected to any system with available I2C.

## Status

The current status of this board is prototyping: design is done, and the first prototypes have arrived and are being assembled by hand. The firmware has not even been started yet. ;)

## What can it be used for?

The Smoothiepanel firmware is designed for maximum usefulness in mind, allowing replaceable and extendable user interface panels. Of course, since it is all [Open Source Hardware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware), one could even rework the firmware to support a comm style other than I2C or even write custom firmware and use a Smoothiepanel LCD Backpack as the core of your own project!

## Getting one

It's not for sale yet, and there are no pre-orders. But if you'd like to get one first when it's released (current estimated release date: early 2013), don't hesitate to make a reservation!
Simply make yourself known by [email here (reprap at logxen dot com)](mailto:reprap@logxen.com) and you'll be added to the list. No strings attached, it's just to help us plan.
