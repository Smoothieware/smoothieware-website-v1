# G28 G-code

The `G28` G-code can mean different things depending on whether you are using a CNC mill, or a 3D printer.

This is because when the Reprap project chose its G-codes, and what they are supposed to do, they completely ignored the existing G-code standard, and messed everything up. 

Not our fault!

On a Reprap, the `G28` G-code means "go to the endstops and stop moving when you have hit them".

On a CNC mill (traditionally), the `G28` G-code means "go to the recorded origin point for the machine".

In the Smoothie firmware, if you set `grbl_mode` to `true` (and/or have the CNC build), it will have the "CNC mill" meaning, and if you set it to `false` (or do not set it at all), it will have the Reprap meaning. See [grbl-mode](grbl-mode).

To see information on the `G28` G-code for CNC mills, see [G28-cnc](g28-cnc)
