== Basics

The Spindle is the main effector on your CNC Mill/Router. It holds the end mill or drill bit, makes it turn and remove material.

While manual control is sometimes fine ( turn it on before starting your G-code, off when you are done ), it is so much neater to have G-codes to control it automatically : simply put an ON G-code at the beginning of your G-code file, and a off G-code at the end of your G-code file, and you don't have to think about it any-more. 

The spindle module supports different types of spindles which are described in the following subsections.

<callout type="info" icon="true">
**NOTE** the spindle module is NOT compiled into the normal smoothie build, you need to use the CNC build.
</callout>

=== General

The spindle module has an option which lets you enable or disable the entire module:

<code>
spindle.enable                                   true   # set this to false to disable the spindle module
</code>

=== G-code

Available G-code commands:
* <kbd>M3</kbd> will start the spindle. <kbd>M3 S5000</kbd> will start the spindle and set speed to 5000 RPM.
* <kbd>M5</kbd> will stop the spindle. Last set RPM is remembered and used for next <kbd>M3</kbd> command if S argument is not given.
* <kbd>M957</kbd> will report the current spindle speed and PWM value. This returns not the actual value but the value that was set through M3.
* <kbd>M958</kbd> will report the current PID parameters. <kbd>M958 Px.xxx Ix.xxx Dx.xxx</kbd> will set them (to save the new values, you need to edit config file manually).

=== PWM Spindle


<callout type="info" icon="true">
The PWM spindle is generic for all spindles that use a direct PWM signal to control the spindle speed directly with a MOSFet.
It needs a feedback sensor to adjust the speed using a PID control.
</callout>

==== Example config options

<code>
spindle.type                                 pwm               # sets the spindle module to PWM mode
spindle.pwm_pin                              2.5               # Big Mosfet Q7. Pin must be hardware PWM capable.
spindle.pwm_period                           1000              # default 1000, sets the PWM frequency
spindle.feedback_pin                         2.7               # Pin must be interrupt capable. 
spindle.pulses_per_rev                       1.0               # default 1. Defines the number of pulses occur for each rotation 
spindle.default_rpm                          5000              # default 5000. Defines a default RPM value in case no RPM value is provided.
spindle.control_P                            0.1               # default 0.0001. P value for the PID controller              
spindle.control_I                            0.1               # default 0.0001. I value for the PID controller
spindle.control_D                            0.1               # default 0.0001. D value for the PID controller
spindle.control_smoothing                    0.1               # default 0.1. This value is low pass filter time constant in seconds.

<callout type="info" icon="true" title="Hobby servo ESC as spindle control">
Since I'm expiriencing with hobby esc+motor combos (1:8 scale 3 phase 4068 like motor) I wanted to share it's config. ESCs act like hobby servos - 20 ms period time, 1.5-2ms duty cycle time -, so insted of having modified the spindle code, I've created a switch for commands M3/M5. Due to the very small duty cycle window you won't have much control over the motor: S7.5 is neutral, S12.5 is "fastest" after calibrating the ESC manually with bCNC (read ESC's manual; below S7.5 is breaking for now).

The following code is working, setting neutral upon boot - ESC init.
<code>
switch.servo.enable                          true             # Servo module for PWM control
switch.servo.input_on_command                M3
switch.servo.input_off_command               M5
switch.servo.output_pin                      1.23o!             # spare pin with PWM capability, 3.25 should also work from EXP2, maybe needed to set it to 1.23o!
switch.servo.output_type                     hwpwm
#switch.servo.pwm_period_ms                  20                #set PWM period to 20ms (50 Hz)
switch.servo.startup_state                   true                # turn on the output to have neutral for ESC
switch.servo.startup_value                   7.5               # this is default_off_value
switch.servo.default_on_value                7.5
switch.servo.failsafe_set_to                 0

=== Analog Spindle

This module is used to control a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-frequency_drive|VFD]] with an PWM that is converted to an 0-10V analog signal by an additional circuit. That circuit also provides an optocoupler for switching the VFD RUN signal. It is also the mode of choice if you run a brushless motor spindle driven by a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_speed_control|ESC]], in that case you will not need any additional circuitry.

<callout type="info" icon="true">
The analog spindle is generic for all VFD's that use a 0-10V speed reference signal, so it doesn't need a special implementation for a certain VFD.
The downside is that the signal is not completely linear and may be interfered by noise. 
If you can use a VFD that supports Modbus/RS485, its highly recommended to use that technique!
</callout>

==== Example config options

<code>
spindle.type                                     analog   # set the spindle type to analog, can also be used for ESC spindles controlled by a PWM
spindle.max_rpm                                  24000    # set the max spindle speed that is achieved at 100% PWM
spindle.pwm_pin                                  2.4      # the pin which emits the PWM signal
spindle.pwm_period                               1000     # the PWM frequency
spindle.switch_on_pin                            2.6      # the pin which is used to enable the VFD (optional)
</code>

==== PWM to analog converter circuit

=== Modbus Spindle

This module is used to control a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-frequency_drive|VFD]] using a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485|RS485]] communication bus.
It provides a Modbus implementation and is easily extendable to support a wide range of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus|Modbus]] compliant VFDs.
But is also can support VFD's that are not compliant with the Modbus standard such as the widely used [[http://www.hy-electrical.com/productshow_e.asp?id=12|Huanyang VFD]] that is popular and cheap on eBay.

<callout type="info" icon="true">
The modbus spindle needs a separate implementation for every VFD model. At the time of writing only the Huanyang is implemented, but is very easy to extend the module for many other models. 
</callout>

==== Example config options

<code>
spindle.type                                     modbus   # set the spindle type to modbus/RS485
spindle.vfd_type                                 huanyang # set the VFD type, this is necessary because each inverter uses its own commands
spindle.rx_pin                                   2.6      # TX pin for the soft serial
spindle.tx_pin                                   2.4      # RX pin for the soft serial
spindle.dir_pin                                  2.5      # RS485 is only half-duplex, so we need a pin to switch between sending and receiving 
</code>

==== Huanyang VFD Modbus Parameters

In order to get the Huanyang VFD accepting commands via ModBus, you need to change a few parameters:

<callout type="info" icon="true">
PD001: 2 (Source of run commands: communication port)
PD002: 2 (Source of operating frequency: communication port)
PD163: 1 (Communication address: 1)
PD164: 1 (Communication Baud Rate: 9600)
PD165: 3 (Communication Data Method: 8N1 RTU)
</callout>

==== RS485 extension board
Like an analog spindle, the Modbus spindle needs a external circuit, but that is much simpler.
