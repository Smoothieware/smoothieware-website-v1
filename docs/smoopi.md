# Smoopi

## Overview

Smoopi is a feature-rich Host written specifically for Smoothie. It can run on an RPI with a touch screen or on a Desktop.
The Host is suitable for controlling both 3D printers and CNC and Laser machines.

Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/wolfmanjm/kivy-smoothie-host.git).

There is a convenient rpi [image](http://smoothieware.org/_media/bin/smoopi.img) file that can be copied to an SD card for a ready-to-go installation.

It also works with a popular Mach3 USB-based pendant called the HB04 (only tested with the wired version, although the wireless may work). All the buttons on the HB04 are configurable, and the LCD is fully operational. This is a great tool for CNC machines.
