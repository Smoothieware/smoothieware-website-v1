# G20 G-code

`G20` means "all moves starting now have their units specified in inches (imperial units)."

`G20`'s evil twin is [`G21`](g21.md), which means "all moves starting now have their units specified in millimeters (metric units)," which is the default when Smoothie starts.

An inch is 25.4 millimeters.

## Format

The command is used as such:

```plaintext
G20
```

Which means: units are now imperial until another G-code changes it (modal command).

## Parameters

No parameters.
