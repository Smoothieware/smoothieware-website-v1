> [!WARNING]
> #### Worldwide shortages
> 
> As you might have heard in the news, there are worldwide shortages of a lot of chips.
> 
> This has had a massive impact on our ability to produce Smoothieboard v1, and to make progress on Smoothieboard v2.
> 
> We currently have managed to produce boards, and there should be stock for the foreseeable future, but this is a constant fight to stay in stock, and you can expect at *some point*, we'll have shortages again like we had at the beginning of 2021.
> 
> The chips are also much more expensive than normal. We were able to get *some* at higher-than-normal-but-not-crazy prices some weeks back (this severely reduces our margins, but for the time being we have decided not to change our prices and to keep all of the effort/cost on our side of the equation rather than on users' side), but at the time of this writing (May 2021), the only chips available have 1000%+ price markups: [https://www.win-source.net/nxp-lpc1769fbd100.html](https://www.win-source.net/nxp-lpc1769fbd100.html). If we end up having to produce boards with those new chip prices, we won't be able to keep the prices the same anymore.
> 
> Hopefully, all of this calms down and fixes itself as 2021 progresses. We'll keep you informed.

## Broken boards

If you feel like a hacker extraordinaire, or can live with a bit of loss of functionality, you can also get partially broken boards [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ebay.fr/itm/142933845406&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1537661637156000&usg=AFQjCNEqrNzH7Dl5bpKcPrc2p-jO6E5_xw) at a very serious discount.
